Just provide the query that returns the Profiles to be updated, and let Grouparoo know which Property the query refers to.</p><p>Naively, <code>SELECT id FROM users</code> would work, and all Profiles would be updated. However, you can often be smarter with your Schedule to keep things fast. For example, if your custom query to calculate LTV would only update when a purchase is made, you might <code>SELECT DISTINCT(user_id) FROM purchases where MAX(created_at) &gt; (NOW() - interval 2 day) GROUP BY user_id</code> to only re-import Profiles which have had a recent purchase.</p>",

This feature revolves around the use of <a href=\"/docs/cli\">our CLI tool</a>, specifically <a href=\"/docs/cli/config#generate\">the <code>generate</code> command</a>.</p><p>The generate command uses your input to write a configuration file to your file system. You can then use this file to configure the various objects in Grouparoo, like <a href=\"/docs/config/apps/community\">Apps</a>, <a href=\"/docs/config/sources/community\">Sources</a>, or <a href=\"/docs/config/destinations/community\">Destinations</a>.</p><p>These templates are then read and processed by Grouparoo when the server starts. This makes it trivial to import and export data from your various data sources and destinations by just writing a few lines of JSON.</p><p>You can work the way you are already working. You check your config files into Git. And you can even <a href=\"/docs/running/testing\">run tests</a> to ensure your data is moving around as you&#x27;d expect.</p><p>See <a href=\"/docs/config/code-config\">the docs</a> for more information on how to configure your Grouparoo project using code config files.
