It&#x27;s smart enough to merge profiles if it turns out the user was actually the same one.</p><p>Once you have those events, you can create a source that makes profile properties from them. For example, let&#x27;s add how many page views a user has had. And another one for what they last looked at. Of course, you can use those when creating groups and syncing to destinations.</p><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><img alt=\"Create a property rule from your events\" src=\"https://www.grouparoo.com/posts/releases/2020-05-25-events.png\" height=\"300\" width=\"511\" style=\"height:300px;width:511px;max-height:100%;max-width:100%\" class=\"imageOutline\"/></div><p>With events, we are excited to help you get an even picture of your customer.</p>",
