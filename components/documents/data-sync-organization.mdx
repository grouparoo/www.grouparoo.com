## Organization

No app stands alone. The goal is to create value for the whole organization. These last few tenants help achieve the promise of a well-built data sync app.

### Iteration is key

Growth engineers like to run tests. Accordingly, optimizing the product is about how many times you can go around the build-learn-iterate loop. The same is true in Marketing, other teams, and the company as a whole.

Because fast iteration leads to business success, the organizational value of a data sync app is a function of how quickly it enables you to respond to new data requests. Change is inevitable, so make them zero point stories.

The best way to make this a reality is to treat your data model as configuration for a sync engine. Have a layered approach where you define the “what” and keep it separate from the “how.” In the day-to-day, this enables you to focus on the data definitions and not be consistently debugging the pipes that move things around.

### Normalize the workflow

This kind of app is different from your normal product in many ways, right? Look at all these rules!

The best results come from treating this app just like all the other product-focused codebases. Manage data sync just like you would any other part of your stack. You test the configuration, check it into git, run it on CI, review, merge, and deploy.

When you make the workflow familiar, you make it approachable to everyone on the team. Success looks like an engineer responding to curiosity to a Marketing request instead of avoiding the conversation. When they say, “Sure, no problem” to data enablement, the whole company wins.

### Create a shared language

Often, struggles around data sync are because the stakeholders are far apart in how they are talking about it. Marketers speak about their email automation use cases. Engineers discuss the database and have never actually seen the email tool.

Creating a robust data sync app is the best way to bridge the gap. It’s a stop-over on this data journey that we can use to discuss requirements concretely. Marketers understand how the data properties in the app end up in their tool. Engineers understand how queries create these properties. Now, both can focus on the correct data definition and not worry always be worrying about the mechanism.

The data rules are designed to get to you to this point. They focus on ease, reliability, observability, and smart integration in order to build this confidence across the whole organization.
