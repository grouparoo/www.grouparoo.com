            <p>
              Grouparoo runs in your environment so you always have access to
              all the code and the data. Use it however you want.

            <h3>Compliance</h3>
            <p>
              The control and privacy features make it easier for you to comply
              with GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific standards.

            <h3>Privacy</h3>
            <p>
              You get to choose exactly what data gets sent to each tool. And
              you give them less because it was only needed to make the groups.

            <h3>Cost</h3>
            <p>
              Because Grouparoo is hosted in your private cloud, weâ€™re
              significantly cheaper than SaaS alternatives that charge based on
              usage.
