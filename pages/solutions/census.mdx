## How Grouparoo is different (and better) than Census

Census is a SaaS-based data syncing tool that started in 2018.

Grouparoo is a newer entrant, having started in early 2020, and is also a data syncing tool built for the modern data stack. Here’s a deeper look into how Grouparoo is different from Census.

### Reverse ETL

Census is a Reverse ETL tool, and so is Grouparoo, but Grouparoo is so much more. Census requires that all of your data already be normalized in a formal data warehouse, and that you have a team to manage it. Grouparoo works great with data warehouses, but we also know that your business is still growing, and not all of your data has been brought into your data warehouse and is regularly updated. What about your customer support data in Zendesk? What about your NPS scores or onboarding surveys? Grouparoo’s library of sources is ready to help everyone, from the data warehouse engineer to the scrappy growth engineer, use their data, wherever it lives.

### Customer Data Platform

Census can point at your data warehouse, while Grouparoo is more flexible. Grouparoo can query your data warehouse and use the data definitions you already have there. If you don’t have a data warehouse though, Grouparoo can also be a Customer Data Platform for you by stitching data together from all of your different data sources.

### Grouparoo also support Events

Even though we’ve railed against overusing Events in the past, there are some instances where Events are a good data model, and Grouparoo supports those use cases! Grouparoo’s core product has automated data syncing. We query your data sources on a schedule that you can set (every 10 minutes, every hour, etc.). In some cases, you really want your customer data in Grouparoo (and all of your destinations) nearly real-time. In those cases, you can use Grouparoo’s Events API to update customer profiles and properties.

There are some user behaviors that you’re unlikely to track, such as every single page view or button click. You can also track those as properties on customer profiles in Grouparoo.

### Open source

One major difference between Census and Grouparoo is that Grouparoo is open source (MPL v2.0 licensed), and available for anyone in the world to download and give it a try. Given our open source approach, Grouparoo is really focused on making the developer experience as easy as possible. All of your customer data can stay within your own virtual private cloud, so you have complete control.

### Cost

Another appealing attribute of Grouparoo is cost. Grouparoo is free to try, and if you use our Community-edition and self-host it, it’s free for you to use forever. There also isn’t a limit to the number of integrations you can use. Census’s starter pricing, on the other-hand, limits the number of integrations you can connect to.
