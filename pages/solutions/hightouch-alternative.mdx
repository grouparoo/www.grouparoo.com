## How Grouparoo is different (and better) than Hightouch

Hightouch is a SaaS-based data syncing tool that started in 2020.

Grouparoo also started in early 2020, and is also a data syncing tool built for the modern data stack. Here’s a deeper look into how Grouparoo is different from Hightouch.

### 🚀 Reverse ETL powered by code

Both Grouparoo and Hightouch are [Reverse ETL](/solutions/reverse-etl) tools, but only Grouparoo was designed to fit into your existing engineering workflow. Grouparoo is powered by configuration files that you can generate and test locally, and then deploy with git - just like you deploy DBT projects today. Being open-source, Grouparoo can be run within your firewall or in our hosted cloud.

### 📀 Multiple Sources

Hightouch requires that all of your data already be normalized in into a single source - your data warehouse. Grouparoo works great with data warehouses, but we also know that your business is still growing, and not all of your data has been brought into your data warehouse and is regularly updated. What about your customer support data in Zendesk? What about your NPS scores or onboarding surveys? Grouparoo’s library of sources is ready to help everyone, from the data warehouse engineer to the scrappy growth engineer, use their data, wherever it lives.

### 📈 SQL-based vs. web-based

In Hightouch, the primary method for building your models and querying your data sources is with SQL. That’s great for folks who know SQL, but many aren’t familiar with SQL or would prefer a no-code or low-code approach. Grouparoo’s enterprise product allows people to define Profile Properties in our web-UI without having to write SQL queries. Once your Grouparoo instance is connected to a source, you can start to define Properties and Groups in the UI. For folks who are comfortable with code and command-line tools though, you can also configure your Grouparoo instance entirely in code, so your team has flexibility across different skill levels.

### 🧑‍💻 Open source

One major difference between Hightouch and Grouparoo is that Grouparoo is open source (MPL v2.0 licensed), and available for anyone in the world to download and give it a try. Given our open source approach, Grouparoo is really focused on making the developer experience as easy as possible. All of your customer data can stay within your own virtual private cloud, so you have complete control.
