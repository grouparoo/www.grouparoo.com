TLDR: This command will fully get rid of the `master` branch after you've switched to using `main`.

> git remote prune origin

What I was seeing was `git checkout master` still referenced the existence of the old branch I had used. I needed to get rid of that old one so that it would be an error.

## The switch

We have switched to using the `main` branch instead of the `master` branch on all [our](https://github.com/grouparoo/www.grouparoo.com) [Github](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo) [projects](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example-heroku).

When you do so, you get this helpful screenshot from Github:

Those instructions typed out:

```bash
> git branch -m master main
> git fetch origin
> git branch -u origin/main main
```

I have also seen this one added:

```bash
> git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
```

## Muscle memory

However, I still had a problem. My fingers kept typing `git checkout master` when I should now be typing `git checkout main`.

I would get over that in time, except that it wasn't giving me an error even though this was not a local or remote branch:

```bash
> git checkout master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'master'

> git checkout blah
error: pathspec 'blah' did not match any file(s) known to git
```

I wanted to get the second result: an error. Then my fingers would learn what my heart and head knew was right.

## Solution

The solution hint came from running this command:

```bash
> git branch -a
* main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/any_old_branch
  remotes/origin/blog_config
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/master
```

So if I did `git checkout any_old_branch` that would not error either _even though_ that was not a local or remote branch.

The solution was to run `git remote prune origin`:

```bash
> git remote prune origin
Pruning origin
URL: git@github.com:grouparoo/www.grouparoo.com.git
 * [pruned] origin/any_old_branch
 * [pruned] origin/blog_config
 * [pruned] origin/master
```

Now it is gone from `git branch -a` and I get the expected result:

```bash
> git checkout master
error: pathspec 'master' did not match any file(s) known to git
```
