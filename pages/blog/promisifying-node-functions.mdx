The Grouparoo application is written in JavaScript (Node). It uses the modern promise-based pattern (`async`/`await`) for reading and writing data asynchronously. And we do this _a lot_ — we are a data sync tool!

Every once in awhile we'll come across a JavaScript library that is written around the old callback-based pattern, where the error object is the first parameter in the callback function, followed by the result.

The old way looked something like this:

```js
doThing('theThing', function(error, result) {
  // Catch the error or do something with result ...
}
```

This pattern isn't compatible with the new approach where I want to wait for each asynchronous function to resolve so I can predict the order in which my code is executed.

Every once in awhile we'll come across a library that follows this old pattern. We'll have to figure out a way to make it work with our code. There are three approaches you can take in many cases:

## Option #1: Find an Existing Wrapper

It's possible there is a promise-based version of the library you're looking to use.

For example, I was looking to work with the [Node-based `sqlite3` library](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3) and I found [a package called `sqlite-async`](https://github.com/fhellwig/sqlite-async).

Personally I don't love this option for two reasons:

1. It's another layer of dependencies that you have to worry about someone keeping up (and that someone is very likely not the author of the thing you _really_ want).
2. It's not that difficult to do yourself (without an additional dependency).

## Option #2: Wrap it Yourself

The [JavaScript Promise API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) is well-built for you to manually wrap the callback-based functions in promises. To _promisify_ those functions.

Take our example:

```js
doThing('theThing', function(error, result) {
  // Catch the error or do something with result ...
}
```

You could wrap this in a promise-based function called `doThingAsync` like so:

```js
doThingAsync(param1) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    doThing(param1, (error, result) => {
      if (error) return reject(error)
      return resolve(result)
    })
  })
}
```

Now you can run the original example like so:

```js
const result = await doThingAsync("theThing");
```

This is a great method when you only need to wrap a few functions or when you want fine-grained control on the output of specific functions. For example, if you want more control over the error messages returned.

If there are a lot of functions to wrap or customize, it might be worth it to go back and look for an existing wrapper (Option #1). But don't go yet — there's a magical third option!

## Option #3: Node's `util.promisify()`

Node has [a built-in promisify utility](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original) that does this work for you.

Using this approach, we can rewrite our original example like so:

```js
import { promisify } from "util";

const doThingAsync = promisify(doThing);
const result = await doThingAsync("theThing");
```

That's super simple! And that's why this is my preferred approach when it can be implemented cleanly.

When we're dealing with an instance of a class or object, we have to bind that object to `promisify`. Here's an example:

```js
const instance = new Thing();
const doThingAsync = promifiy(instance.doThing).bind(instance);
const result = await doThingAsync("theThing");
```
