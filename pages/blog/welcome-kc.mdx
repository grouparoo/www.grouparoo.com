The promise of open source is one of community. It is about people making great things together.

With that in mind, maybe it's not suprising that we first met [KC Glick](https://github.com/krishnaglick) years ago when he contributed to the [Actionhero](https://www.actionherojs.com/) project that is at the core of Grouparoo. Now, he's on the Grouparoo team and will be contributing throughout the stack.

KC comes to us most recently from iHeart, the media company that runs all those stations we listen to. As a team lead there, he showed he also has the collaboration skills needed to help us continue to built out a great engineering team.

Welcome, KC! We are so excited to have you here.
