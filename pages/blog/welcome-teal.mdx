We are excited to have [Teal Larson](https://twitter.com/tealdoestech) come aboard Grouparoo as an engineer.

Teal has already started [working on](https://github.com/grouparoo/www.grouparoo.com/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3Atealjulia+) our www site, building out pages that help communicate what we are building and for whom.

We have doubled our Pacific Northwest cohort. I think that means that we will have to plan a trip up there for a hiking offsite.

The first thing I noticed about Teal was her time outside of tech as a language arts teacher. Working with people that have a full-range of experiences makes us so much better. In fact, she has even made this blog post better because I just remembered that it's "whom" above. I think.

Welcome, Teal! We are so glad to have you here.
