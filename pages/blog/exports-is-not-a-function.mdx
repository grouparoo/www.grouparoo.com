I have been working on the [Salesforce integration](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/pull/754). That experience will be its own story. In the process, though, I found something tricky that I might be uniquely experiencing given the combinatorics of the modern Node/Javascript/Typescript world.

[Grouparoo](https://www.grouparoo.com) connects with sources, processes the data from them, and sends that data to destinations. When data comes from a source, we call it an `import`. When data is sent to a destination, we call it an `export`. These are very good names, in my opinion, because they accurately reflect what is happening and they are known words in the engineering community.

The downside of `import` and `export` being well-known words is that they might be used for other purposes. In this case, `import` and `export` are somewhat magical words when it comes to Javascript. Some code might look like this:

```typescript
import { ExportProfilesPluginMethod } from "@grouparoo/core";

export const connect = async({appOptions}) {
  // get a connection to salesforce
}

export const exportProfiles: ExportProfilesPluginMethod = async ({
  appOptions,
  destinationOptions,
  exports,
}) => {
  // call function defined above
  const client = await connect(appOptions);
  // do stuff with client and exports array
};
```

Notice that `import` is used to pull in code from `@grouparoo/core`, who has defined what it means to be a destination that processes batches of profiles. Notice that `export` is also used to make the function we are writing available to other code that uses this file.

Everything works fine in my [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) tests. Then it starts running for real, and I get this stacktrace:

```bash
TypeError: exports.connect is not a function
    at exports.exportProfiles (/grouparoo/plugins/@grouparoo/salesforce/dist/lib/export-objects/exportProfiles.js:16:20)
    at Object.sendExports (/grouparoo/core/api/src/modules/ops/destination.ts:563:53)
    ...
```

What happened here? Of course, `connect` is a function. Things worked when I tested it, too.

Eventually, the answer reveals itself when I looked at the "real" code that was running. Typescript gets transpiled to Javascript. Here is the "real" code:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.exportProfiles = exports.connect = void 0;

exports.connect = async ({ appOptions }) => {
  // get a connection to salesforce
};

exports.exportProfiles = async ({
  appOptions,
  destinationOptions,
  exports,
}) => {
  // call function defined above
  const client = await exports.connect({ appOptions });
  // do stuff with client and exports array
};
```

Clearly some weird stuff gets added here, but it looks about right. So what's the issue?

## The Issue

The issue is that our variable name was `exports`. That's a good name, but there's a name collision. When the code got compiled, it saw that the `connect` method wasn't just a regular function, it was on the global `exports` of the file, so it called `exports.connect`. However, the variable names `exports` overrode the global. So when it ran, it looked for a function called `connect` on the `exports` variable that was passed in.

What should have happened? If you look at these compiled `.js` files, you sometimes see `var_1` and such. I would have hoped that it would have ended up like this:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.exportProfiles = exports.connect = void 0;

exports.connect = async ({ appOptions }) => {
  // get a connection to salesforce
};

exports.exportProfiles = async ({
  appOptions,
  destinationOptions,
  exports_1,
}) => {
  // call function defined above
  const client = await exports.connect({ appOptions });
  // do stuff with client and exports_1 array
};
```

And everywhere that used the `exports` variable would the use the `exports_1` variable.

## A Functional Solution

As exciting as it sounded to upgrade compilation, I made the following change to the original code:

```typescript
import { ExportProfilesPluginMethod } from "@grouparoo/core";

export const connect = async({appOptions}) {
  // ...
}

const myConnectMethod = connect;
export const exportProfiles: ExportProfilesPluginMethod = async ({
  appOptions,
  destinationOptions,
  exports,
}) => {
  // call function re-named above
  const client = await myConnect(appOptions);
  // do stuff with client and exports array
};
```

That change resulted in the following Javascript:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.exportProfiles = exports.connect = void 0;

exports.connect = async ({ appOptions }) => {
  // get a connection to salesforce
};

const myConnectMethod = exports.connect;
exports.exportProfiles = async ({
  appOptions,
  destinationOptions,
  exports,
}) => {
  // call function re-named above
  const client = await myConnectMethod({ appOptions });
  // do stuff with client and exports array
};
```

By calling a reference that is _not_ being exported, everything works as expected.

## A Naming Solution

Another option would be to rename the variable. This is still possible even with the destructured input.

```typescript
import { ExportProfilesPluginMethod } from "@grouparoo/core";

export const connect = async({appOptions}) {
  // ...
}

export const exportProfiles: ExportProfilesPluginMethod = async ({
  appOptions,
  destinationOptions,
  exports : profilesToExport,
}) => {
  // call function defined above
  const client = await connect(appOptions);
  // do stuff with client and profilesToExport array
};
```

This change resulted in the following Javascript:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.exportProfiles = exports.connect = void 0;

exports.connect = async ({ appOptions }) => {
  // get a connection to salesforce
};

const myConnectMethod = exports.connect;
exports.exportProfiles = async ({
  appOptions,
  destinationOptions,
  exports: profilesToExport,
}) => {
  // call function defined above
  const client = await exports.connect({ appOptions });
  // do stuff with client and profilesToExport array
};
```

By making the variable name something that is not reserved, everything works as expected.
