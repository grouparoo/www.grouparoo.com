Building an open source tool to connect data to many different services means a lot of integrations.

It can be pretty tricky, so we were lucky to meet [Pedro S Lopez](https://twitter.com/pedroslopez) a few weeks back when he started [adding](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Apedroslopez+) several plugins to that integration list. He has now come aboard officially and will work more on the core product.

Pedro makes the Grouparoo team an international one. Working with great people all over the world is a key benefit of having a distributed team.

The first thing I noticed about Pedro was his Node.js [app](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) that reverse engineers the WhatsApp web app to help people communicate. What dedication to messaging automation!

Welcome, Pedro! We are so excited to have you here.
