Grouparoo’s new [App Refresh Query](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#app-refresh-query)) feature enables users to run their Grouparoo schedules whenever a given query returns new data. This means you can do things like update your Users and Purchases data anytime your Payments table is updated or run all of your Schedules every time a dbt job completes.

We’ve talked about how to [integrate dbt with Grouparoo](/blog/dbt-and-grouparoo) in your Reverse ETL process before. One use case that was important for us to support is how to integrate Grouparoo into an existing dbt project and trigger schedules automatically when a dbt run completes -- including for users on our [Hosted offering](/pricing). Now, you’re able to run Grouparoo after a dbt run regardless of if you're self-hosting or cloud hosted.

In this article, we’ll walk through how we used our new App Refresh Query feature to update our dbt example project.

This same process will work with any dbt project using Bigquery, Postgres, Redshift, or Snowflake. If you are using Clickhouse, you can still use the `on-run-end` hook and App Refresh Query, though you’ll have to configure your credentials rather than using the `@grouparoo-dbt` wraparound plugin.

## Tracking dbt run metadata

If you aren’t currently keeping track of metadata from your dbt runs, you can use a [`macro`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/jinja-macros) along with an [`on-run-end` hook](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/on-run-start-on-run-end) to generate one automatically. In our example project, we started this by adding the following to `dbt_project.yml`:

```yml
on-run-end: "{{ on_run_end(results) }}"
```

Then, in `/macros`, we added a file called `on_run_end.sql`. In this file, we used [Jinja](<[https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)>) and SQL to build out a `dbt_meta` table that stores successes, errors, and skips for each run, as well as a timestamp. It will also log the number of successes, errors, and skips when it is executed after a `dbt run`.

## Connecting with Grouparoo

### Self-hosted / Code Config

Take a look at our [dbt example app](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example-dbt) to see how we’ve set up our configuration. One notable difference from typical Grouparoo configuration is that at the App level we’ve utilized our dbt plugin to fetch credentials from our dbt Profile. The dbt plugin will also be able to tell what environment you’re in (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) and will use the proper version of your warehouse.

We’ve also added a “refresh” object to our App that will generate an [App Refresh Query](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#app-refresh-query). The query here will check every minute to see if there is a new timestamp in the `last_run_at` column of `dbt_meta`

```js

const { dbtProfile } = require("@grouparoo/dbt");

exports.default = async function buildConfig() {

  // fetch warehouse connection details from parent dbt profile

  const { type, options } = await dbtProfile();

  return [

    {

      class: "app",

      id: "warehouse",

      name: "Warehouse",

      refresh: {

	query: “SELECT MAX(last_run_at) FROM dbt_meta”

	recurringFrequency: 60 * 1000

      }

      type,

      options,

    },

  ];

};

```

From here, you can start your Grouparoo server from the command line. Check that you are in the `/grouparoo` directory in your dbt project and run:

```

grouparoo start

```

### UI Enterprise / Cloud Hosted

Grouparoo also offers a Cloud Hosted version of our product as well as a license for self-hosted UI Enterprise. For those versions, the setup will be a little different. You’ll want to follow the steps in our [Config Guide for Apps](<[https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/apps](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/apps)>).

  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--06-configure-refresh-query.png"
  width={1824}
  height={877}
/>

Once your App is configured, you'll want to open the Refresh tab and use the following
as your Refresh query:

```sql

SELECT MAX(last_run_at) FROM dbt_meta

```

You can then use our UI Enterprise setup steps or [Config Guides](<[http://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config](http://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config)>) to complete your setup.

## Next Steps

Now, anytime a dbt run is completed, whether it’s by manually running `dbt run` or part of a cron job, all our Grouparoo data will be checked for updates and all of our schedules (in this case, just the one on our `mailchimp data` source) will be run.
