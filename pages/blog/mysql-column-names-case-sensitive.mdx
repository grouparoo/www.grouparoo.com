There is a debate among a very specific set of people about what case to use in SQL queries. This debate is made possible by the fact that, generally, it does not matter. I believed this to be true even about [identifiers](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html) like columns names.

For example, both of these queries returns the same data even though the "real" column is defined in lowercase.

- `SELECT first_name FROM users`
- `SELECT FIRST_NAME FROM USERS`

Let's try in the MySQL console.

```
mysql> SELECT first_name FROM users;
+------------+
| first_name |
+------------+
| John       |
| Sarah      |
+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

```
mysql> SELECT FIRST_NAME FROM USERS;
+------------+
| FIRST_NAME |
+------------+
| John       |
| Sarah      |
+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Notice that the data is the same, but the "header" is different in each case.

So let's say I had code like this:

```js
connection.query(
  "SELECT first_name FROM users",
  function (error, results, fields) {
    console.log("The user is: ", results[0].first_name);
  }
);
```

This would output `The user is: John` as expected. However, if the uppercase query was used (`SELECT FIRST_NAME FROM USERS`) instead, it would output `The user is: undefined`.

So you have to be a little careful here, but often, the same code is doing the query and using it. Its tends to work out.

## But not always?

Our tool, [Grouparoo](https://www.grouparoo.com) connects to sources like MySQL to learn about customers and sync that data to destinations like Salesforce. In this process, we have to introspect the database.

We do a query that looks something like this:

```
mysql> SELECT column_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    ->   WHERE table_schema = 'db' AND table_name = 'users';
+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME |
+-------------+
| first_name  |
| id          |
+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Do you see what has happened here? I asked for lowercase `column_name` like before, but I got back uppercase `COLUMN_NAME`.

I have not been able to figure what is going on other than to assume the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is just different. I previously believed it was the same as all other tables in all respects.

We had only encountered lowercase values returned, but then ran across this one with a new user. Our code with `row.column_name` failed because it was `undefined`.

## So what to do?

Having seen this, I was lacking the confidence to assume it was either way. The solution that I came up in the [pull request](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/pull/1809) was to be more explicit.

The code now does this query:

```
mysql> SELECT column_name AS column_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    ->   WHERE table_schema = 'db' AND table_name = 'users';
+-------------+
| column_name |
+-------------+
| first_name  |
| id          |
+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

I don't feel like this should be necessary, but you can't argue with (database) results.

Now, the `row.column_name` works as expected and we can help users pick the column(s) they want to sync to their tools.
