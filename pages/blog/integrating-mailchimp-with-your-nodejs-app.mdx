# Integrating MailChimp with your Node.js App

If you're reading this blog right now, the chances are that you're finding your way to add a MailChimp integration into your Node.js application. Don't worry; we have you covered! This is a step by step guide that will help you build a sample Node.js backend for your webpage and help you integrate it with the MailChimp API.
This tutorial will discuss all the different things you need to look for within MailChimp with references to their excellent API documentation. We'll also talk about an alternative method using Grouparoo, which will do all the heavy lifting for you!

## Getting started

To get started, you'll be needing the following things prepared: 
- A MailChimp Account 
- Node.js & npm installed on your machine 
- A basic frontend application to send requests to your Node.js application.

This guide will help you make a sample Node.js application with Express to send and receive API requests and responses. Although a basic knowledge of Node.js would be helpful, you can easily follow the steps given and get started with your application.

## Setting up your MailChimp account

Setting up your MailChimp account is a relatively simple process. In this tutorial, we're assuming that you have created a free MailChimp account and are looking to integrate it within your application. The process is pretty similar for premium accounts, just that you can create multiple audiences, each having their separate Audience ID. To integrate your app with Mailchimp, we need to pieces of information from your account:
1. MailChimp Account API Key
2. Audience ID

### Getting your API Key

For integrating your app, the first and most important thing needed is an API Key. This is a relatively easy step; have a look at the steps below.

1. Go to the bottom left corner of the screen and click on the **Account** option.

/>

2. On the Account page, you’ll find a menu. Click on **Extras** and find the **API Keys** option.

3. If you’re opening this up for the first time, you’ll see a screen similar to this one here. You need to have an API key to integrate your MailChimp account to your NodeJS application. To do this, click on **Create A Key**.

  height={603}
/>

4. Once you click on it, you’ll see that MailChimp has created an API key for you! It will look something similar to this here
<Image

  height={317}
/>

We have displayed the latter portion of our API Key in the image above. One thing to note here are the last three characters after the `-`. This represents the data center corresponding to your account, which is for all the API calls one can make. For us, it is us6. This might be different for you, so make sure to note this separately.

### Finding your Audience ID

Next up, we need to find our Audience ID. For this, just follow this 2 step process :)

1. Go to the audience tab and click on **All contacts**.

## Setting up your Node.js Application

We're assuming that you have a sample frontend application for this tutorial, where users can quickly enter their email and click on the signup button to register on your mailing list.

Here's what a sample request from the frontend might look like:

```
cta.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    if(this.email.value == null || this.email.value == "") {
      console.log("error: email not added");
    } else {
      let fetchData = {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({email: this.email.value}),
        headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
      }

      fetch('/subscribe', fetchData)
        .then(res => {
          console.log("success:", res)
        })
        .catch(res => {
          console.log("error:", res)
        })
    }
  })
```

Here, on click, the function checks for the validity of email and accordingly places a `POST request` on the '/subscribe' endpoint of our application with the body containing the `email` value entered by the user.

For simplicity, we're logging in all the error messages into the browser console.

Now, when we have set up our frontend, let's create our backend!

It is time to make a `package.json` file to capture all the necessary modules required by our project in your repository.

```
$ npm init
```

This will ask you for a few project details and initiate a package.json file inside your repository.

Now it is time to install all our necessary modules for the project. We will require the following modules:
- `express`: Helps us define the routing table and set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests 
- `body-parser`: It is responsible for parsing the incoming request bodies in a middleware before we handle it.
- `request`: Helps us make HTTP requests

```
$ npm install express body-parser request
```

Perfect, so now we can go ahead and get our hands dirty to write some actual code!

Inside your project, create a new `app.js` file.

Let’s do some basic setup here as well, getting our modules imported and connecting the middlewares.

As a first step, let’s import all the modules we just installed:

```
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const request = require("request");
```

We’ll be needing the `path` as well.

```
const path = require("path");
```

Now, let’s define our application quickly.

```
const app = express();
```

Now, we need to define our middleware. 

1. To send the JSON data from the client, we will be using the `express.json()` middleware. 
```
app.use(express.json());
```

2. To parse the data that is coming from the POST request, we will be using `body-parser`
```
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
```

Note that we have set `extended` to `false`, which means that the values can only be `strings` or `arrays` which is what we need for now.

3. Next up, we need to specify the folder which contains your frontend application and connect it to the express server. Here, we’re having a folder named `public`, which includes all our frontend code.

```
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
```

4. Perfect, let's create our `POST` request quickly. We're just setting it up to add a `console.log()` to check if everything's working as expected.

```
app.post('/subscribe', (req, res) => {
    console.log(“I am listening”);
})
```

5. Now let's define the `PORT` which will host our application. 

```
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8888;
```

This sets the value to the environment `PORT` value in case we're using a cloud hosting or default it to 8888, which is our local machine endpoint.

6. Finally, for all this to work, let's start a socket that listens for our connections on the `PORT`.
```
app.listen(PORT, console.log('The server has started!'));
```

7. Woof! That's so much setup for just a basic API request. Let's test our setup up till now. We'll be using the node command for this.

```
node app
```

As soon as you run it, you will notice that the terminal says

```
The server has started!
```

You can also check your frontend to start a post request by entering the email field. As soon as you do that, you'll notice the terminal says

```
I am listening
```

This proves that our server is up and running, and the post request has also gone through. If you do not have a frontend and want to test this, you can easily use a tool like Postman and send a `POST` request similar to the one we have mentioned above for the frontend application.

Now finally, it is time to do some real fun stuff! Let’s integrate this with MailChimp!

## Connecting your Node.js App to MailChimp

For this whole process, we’re directly referring to the [MailChimp API Documentation](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-activity/). They have excellent documentation stating all the different things you need to be aware of with extremely detailed resources. Make sure to check that out if you need any additional information that is not mentioned here directly.

We’re using the standard URL route here. You can also download the [MailChimp NodeJS module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailchimp-api-v3) if you want to as well. Although this makes your life easier in implementing the API, it adds many other modules that we do not need for this particular project. 

### Getting your API Endpoint

So the first thing here is to get the URL of your API. If you check the documentation, the URL looks something like `https://<dc>.api.mailchimp.com/3.0`

Here the `<dc>` corresponds to the data center applicable for your account. If you go back to *step 4* of **Getting your API Key**, you can see that for us, the data center is `us6`. Hence for us, the URL looks something like `https://us6.api.mailchimp.com/3.0`

Now we have to navigate to the particular list where this API will go and hit before we can start doing operations in it. You can see from *step 4* of **Finding your Audience ID** that our **Audience/ List Id** is `ac7ad45fa0`. So finally out endpoint URL will look something like
```
https://us6.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/ac7ad45fa0
```

### Signing up a user to your mailing list

So currently, as we can see from our earlier setup, our server is listening to `/subscribe`. However, it is not doing anything other than just letting us know, in the console, that it is working. Now, we’ll be grabbing the request from here and directing it later to the MailChimp API.

So, let’s grab our email from the request quickly.

```
app.post('/subscribe', (req, res) => {
   const {email} = req.body;
})
```

Perfect, now with that in place, let’s make the data we’ll be passing to our MailChimp. We’ll be naming the object as `addData`. As per the MailChimp Documentation, this object accepts a property called `members`. The `members` property accepts multiple objects, but here we’ll be just looking for two,
- `email_address`: Email address for a subscriber.
- `status`: Subscriber's current status. Possible values: `subscribed`, `unsubscribed`, `cleaned`, or `pending`. We’ll be using `pending` as the status here since it helps us create a double opt-in list. MailChimp on our behalf will automatically send out the confirmation email if the status is pending. Once a person clicks the link and verifies, their email will show up in your Audience List!

```
app.post('/subscribe', (req, res) => {
   const {email} = req.body;
   const addData = {
         members: [
            {
               email_address: email,
               status: ‘pending’
            }
         ]
   }
})
```

So finally, we need to `JSON.stringify()` this so that it can be passed on to the MailChimp API. 

```
addDataJson = JSON.stringify(addData);
```

Perfect, so this is done. But this was just the data. Let’s structure the request to be sent as well. We will be making an `options` object for this. This contains the following properties:
- `url`: The API Endpoint we created above containing your `List ID` as well.
- `method`: This is a post request, so `POST`.
- `headers`: This contains all the important information like Authorization. We’ll be passing over your `API Key` here.
- `body`: Here we’ll be passing over the actual body, ie `addDataJson`.

The code will look something like this:

```
const options = {
   url: ‘https://us6.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/ac7ad45fa0’,
   method: ‘POST’,
   headers: {
      Authorization: ‘auth <YOUR_API_KEY>’
   },
   body: addDataJson
}

```

Perfect, now it is time for sending this request over to MailChimp, yay! For this we will be using the `request` module we previously imported.

```
request (options, (error, response, body) => {
   if(error) {
      res.json({error}) // error :(
   } else {
      res.sendStatus(200); //successful :)
   }
})
```

And that’s it! We’re done with the code here! You have successfully made way for people to opt-in for your mailing list!

## Alternative Method - Using an off the shelf solution

As you can see, just to configure a single API function, we needed to go through a considerable integration pain, which again is a code you need to maintain regularly. What I generally use and recommend to you all is definitely, Grouparoo. 

Grouparoo is a data syncing platform that connects directly to your product database, allows you and your team to define what customer data you care about, and then syncs that data to Mailchimp. The best part, the tool is fully open source! You can easily choose between a self-hosted or a cloud offering. Using this will be just a matter of minutes to build this integration, and anyone can easily use the GUI to configure it!
