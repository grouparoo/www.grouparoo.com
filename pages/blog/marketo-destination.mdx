Grouparoo can now connect with [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com) as a destination. Now, you can leverage all the information you already have in Grouparoo, such as profile information and group membership, and send it to Marketo. It will sync continously in real-time, updating leads and putting them in lists within Marketo.

## Marketo setup

In Marketo, you will need to create the user and gather the settings for Grouparoo to connect.

First, we suggest making a new role called "API Permissions" or "Grouparoo" to use.

Then, let's make a user with that role to connect via the API. Be sure to check the "API Only" checkbox in this process.

Grouparoo will also need the "Endpoint" and "Identity" REST API settings from the "Web Services" section of the Marketo admin.

The other settings come from a new "LaunchPoint" service tied to the user you created. So let's create the service from the "Launchpoint" admin. Once created, clicking on "View Details" will give you the "Client Id" and "Client Secret" that you will need to authenticate to Marketo.

## Create a Grouparoo app

In Grouparoo, apps provide the settings to be able to connect to other platforms. For Marketo, we can use the information from the last section to configure your Marketo app. At this point if you hit "Test Connection," you should see "Test Passed."

## Create a Grouparoo destination

You are ready to start sending your profile data to Marketo. You do this by creating a destination. Destinations connect the profile and group membership data in Grouparoo with external tools like Marketo.

In Marketo's case, Grouparoo will create a Person record for each Grouparoo Profile, setting the properties that are specified. You can choose between the built-in Marketo Fields and any custom Marketo fields you've created. Grouparoo Groups become Marketo Lists. Because everything is automated, it is like you are uploading a new static list every minute with exactly the right people.

## Results

All people with an email address now show up in Marketo. Grouparoo made a "High Value" group and other groups too. The correct people have been placed in each list.

/>

From here, you can do whatever you want in Marketo. For example, you can trigger a campaign when someone is added to the "High Value" list.

## Implementation Details

Our Marketo plugin is the first destination plugin that takes advantage of Grouparoo's batching capability. Instead of sending one profile at a time, Grouparoo sends many at once. Working on one profile at a time can be more reliable but will cause more API requests to the destination. Marketo has a 50,000 requests per day limit, which is not that much for Grouparoo users.

> Grouparoo saves API calls and makes the integration more reliable by working on many profiles at once and sending them in one batch.

Another interesting piece of the integration was where to create the Marketo lists. Marketo Lists exist in a folder structure. We decided to create Lists in the root folder, but allow them to be moved anywhere after that. In the picture above, we've placed Grouparoo-generated Lists in a "Group Lists" subfolder, for example.
