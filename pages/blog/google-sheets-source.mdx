Grouparoo has the ability to connect to a Google Sheet to bring data into its customer data platform (CDP). This enables all of those crazy sheets out there to be the source of truth for your profiles and be fed into your marketing tools. Don't forget: with great power comes great responsibility!

## Google setup

In Grouparoo, apps make the connection to facilitate data movement in the form of sources and destinations. In the Google Sheet case, what we need is to teach Grouparoo how to be able to read things in your Google Drive. It uses something called "Service Accounts." So let's make one of those if you haven't already.

In the [credentials section](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) of the Google API console, you can make a new Service Account.

/>

This allows you to essentially make a user that will have access to the documents that are shared with them. After that, there are some other screens about making roles, but those are not necessary. You can hit "Cancel" on that.

/>

When clicking on your new Service Account, you can now make a key. This is the information you will give to Grouparoo to be able to connect as this new user.

/>

Creating a key in this way, automatically downloads a `.json` file that looks something like this:

<Image

  alt="JSON for a Google Service Account key"

/>

We will need the `private_key` and the `client_email` to setup an app in Grouparoo.

## Create a Grouparoo app

In Grouparoo, you make a new app from the "Platform" section in the navigation. Things in this section are meant to be done by engineers (as indicated by all the "credentials" and "JSON" talk above).

For Google Sheets, you paste in the `client_email` and the `private_key` straight from the JSON file. The `private_key` is a bit long, but just go with it. It's ok to include those `\n` characters as-is.

/>

You can "Test Connection" to make sure everything is working.

So now, you should have your app ready to go!

## Give access to the document

In a document that you want to share with Grouparoo, you share it with this Service Accout. In this example case, it was `grouparoo-access@sample-sources.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. Yours will likely look similiar to this:

<Image
  maxHeight={400}
  alt="Give the Service Account access to the document"
  src="google-sheets-source/add-user-to-access.png"
/>

I like this model because it means that the owners of the document can control what Grouparoo has access to.

## Create a Grouparoo source

You are ready to start pulling in data from Google Sheets. You do this through creating a Grouparoo source for each sheet. Note: there can be many sheets within a document. These words are hard.

You paste the URL in for the sheet to create a new source. It gives you a data preview so you know it's working.

<Image
  maxHeight={400}
  alt="Data preview of new source from Google Sheets"
  src="google-sheets-source/source-data-preview.png"
/>

How does Grouparoo know who is who in this sheet? You teach it through making a mapping.

<Image
  maxHeight={400}
  alt="Data preview of new source from Google Sheets"
  src="google-sheets-source/source-mapping.png"
/>

In this case, my spreadsheet had a `UserID` and I could map them to the same concept that I've already been loading in from a MySQL source. If this was another sheet (like the result of a Google Form) and we had their email address, we could map it that.

## Create a profile property rule and a schedule

For each column in the sheet, you now can pull that in and associate it with the profile. In Grouparoo, this is done via a profile property rule. So let's go ahead and make the the rule.

<Image
  maxHeight={400}
  alt="Add a profile property rule for the column"
  src="google-sheets-source/profile-property-rule.png"
/>

How often should Grouparoo check that sheet for new data? You can tell it by making a schedule.

Now, you have everything you need. It's on auto-pilot from here on out. It will check the Google Sheet every hour and update all the profiles with the data.

  alt="Google Sheet source rule and schedule"

/>

## Results

When it runs, you can then see the results in each profile.

<Image
  maxHeight={400}
  alt="Profile has the data from the Google sheet"
  src="google-sheets-source/profile.png"
/>

And you can also use it to make groups.

<Image
  maxHeight={400}
  alt="Groups can use the data from the Google sheet"
  src="google-sheets-source/group.png"
/>

Because of the schedule, it will always be up to date. This data can be sent to destinations like Mailchimp.

## Implementation Details

I researched for a quite a bit to figure out the best way to connect to Google Drive. Service Accounts seemed to be the best option. I like that the owner of the document can choose to share it. I also didn't want to have multiple people have to oauth.

The [Google API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs) for this stuff is probably very powerful, but it seemed quite complicated just to read these sheets. The [google-spreadsheet](https://github.com/theoephraim/node-google-spreadsheet) library really simplified things.
