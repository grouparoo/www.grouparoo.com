I was testing the new [Intercom](https://intercom.com) plugin that our team had built, and ran into a strange snag. When adding apps to Grouparoo, we have this handy ‚ÄúTest Connection‚Äù button that checks to make sure the connection details and credentials work. When I was testing this new Intercom plugin, something strange appeared this time around.

I was testing locally, but the Test Connection button actually talks to an external API, so I was confused that the connection failed due to something from localhost.

Brian and I fiddled around with various `.env` variables, double-checked the Intercom Access Token, and poked around a bunch in Intercom settings to make sure that we didn‚Äôt mess up some permissions settings.

After we spent an embarassing amount of time debugging, I remembered that I had [Disconnect VPN](https://disconnect.me) installed, which blocks a bunch of various trackers and ad networks. I opened up Disconnect and saw that they‚Äôd recently added Intercom to their block list.

After I turned off Disconnect, I was able to connect to Intercom just fine.

This experience served as yet another reminder that as tools become more sophisticated at blocking ads and trackers like [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com), Facebook Ads, and [Segment](https://segment.com), front-end events will become less useful to businesses (and less creepy to the general public!).

And this experience was also a reminder to always check your VPN settings when testing and developing. üòÖ
