Open source projects become important only through their communities.

Because of this, we have been looking for the right person to help build awareness, work with and represent the community, and generally make everyone happier. I am so glad we found [Maria Silverhardt](https://twitter.com/MsDataDetective). The stories I have heard about her from her community members are inspiring.

Maria is the first non-engineer to join the team, though she has some skills there, too. We know that it takes more than just working code to make projects like ours successful and we are investing to create a helpful and welcoming community from the start.

Welcome, Maria! We are so excited to have you here.
