We have provided an [example Grouparoo app](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example) for a while, but now we've made it easier to generate one of these with a simple command: `npx grouparoo generate` (edit Feb 9, 2021: the command is now `grouparoo init`)

From `npx grouparoo --help`

```
Usage: grouparoo [options] [command]

Options:
  -V, --version    output the version number
  -h, --help       display help for command

Commands:
  generate [path]  generate a new Grouparoo project
  upgrade [path]   upgrade an existing Grouparoo project
  help [command]   display help for command
```
