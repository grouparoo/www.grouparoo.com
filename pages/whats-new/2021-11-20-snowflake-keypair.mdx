As of version 0.7.4, Grouparoo's [Snowflake integration](/integrations/sources/snowflake) now supports using [key pair authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html) for enhanced authentication security as an alternative to basic username and password authentication.

To get started, just upgrade to the latest version of Grouparoo and create a new "Snowflake (Keypair)" app. For more information on how to format and provide the keys, please check out the plugin's [README](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/tree/main/plugins/%40grouparoo/snowflake#notes-on-formatting-your-p8-private-key-when-using-a-snowflake-keypair-app).
