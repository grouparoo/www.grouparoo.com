When creating sources on larger datasets, the web page was often timing out. It turns out it was from selecting rows to show as the preview, which takes a long time in many SQL systems.

While it is nice to show a good sample of rows, it's not worth it. We updated the logic to pick the first few rows and now everything is fast again.
