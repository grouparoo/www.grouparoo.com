We have added [Sailthru](https://www.sailthru.com) as a destination. This means you can export your profile and group data to this email automation tool. One great thing to do there is to use their Lifecycle Optimizer to run campaigns when someone enters a group.

A few companies have noted that they had some challenges integrating with Sailthru nuances, so we are glad to add, iterate, and harden this plugin.
