The Grouparoo UI packages, `@grouparoo/ui-community` and `@grouparoo/ui-enterprise` now install faster and require fewer dependencies on your machines!

Previously, we were shipping the raw Typescript/Javascript files for our React frontend to our customers, and every time you ran `npm install`, you were also building the webpack bundle. Now, we do this all for you on our build servers. This leads to larger download sizes, but a faster overall install experience as there is no "build" step. Under the hood, we rely on [next.js](https://nextjs.org) to build and package our UIs.
