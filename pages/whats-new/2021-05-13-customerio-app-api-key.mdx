In order to perform requests to the APP API required by the newest [Sync Modes](https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/using-sync-modes) concept, Grouparoo now asks for the App API key. [Customer.io](https://customer.io/) separates their API into 2 different parts, the `TRACK API` and the `APP API`. However, you cannot access the Track API with the App API key nor, access the App API with the track API key.
