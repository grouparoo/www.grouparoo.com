We have added [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) as a destination. You can now create Salesforce Objects from your profiles and Groups.

It is a very generic integration because many people use Salesforce in many different ways. Because of this, you can configure it however you want.

For example, you can sync your profiles to create Contacts with linked Accounts. Groups can the decide what Campaigns they are in. It will automatically keep everything up to date.
