You can now run Grouparoo locally without needing to run Redis. This feature makes it possible for you to try out Grouparoo without needing any dependencies! In your `.env` file, set your redis URL to `REDIS_URL="redis://mock"`. If you choose to run Grouparoo this way, you can't use Grouparoo in a cluster. Additionally there is no data persistence, so if you stop and restart your server, there will be data loss.

This update is an important part of the foundation for Grouparoo v0.2.
