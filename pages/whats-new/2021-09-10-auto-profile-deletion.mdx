As part of the v0.6 release, Grouparoo now checks for Profiles that have been deleted from their primary source and removes them from the system. This means that Profiles can be automatically cleared out from Destinations they're synced to when you've removed them from your Data Warehouse.

This behavior can be configured to run along with your existing Schedule, as well as periodically. For more information, check out our [v0.6 upgrade guide](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/support/upgrading-grouparoo/v05-v06#automatically-deleting-profiles).
