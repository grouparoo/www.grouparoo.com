Following our release of [Declarative Sync](/docs/tutorials/app-example-config), we created [an example Grouparoo instance](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example-config) to give Grouparoo a try before adding your data.

While this example app has been around for a bit, we gave it a few updates recently to make it easier to tinker with. It now uses SQLite as a data source. And it comes with instructions on how to load fake data into a SQLite database prior to running the application. This enables you to try Grouparoo in an end-to-end instance without needing to use your production data.

We will continue to iterate on this example and others as [we add more tutorials](/docs/tutorials). As always, [we'd love to chat](/meet) about your ideas for making Grouparoo better.
