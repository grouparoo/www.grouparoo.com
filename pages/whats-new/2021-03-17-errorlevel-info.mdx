There are many variations of things that could go "wrong" when working with the many destinations that Grouparoo supports. For example, there a recoverable errors like rate limiting. However, there is sometimes expected behavior that is still interesting to note. For these cases, we have added an `info` error level.

For example, the Salesforce destination has an "Enrich" mode. This means that it should only update users that are already in the system. In these cases, the plugin returns an `info` error. This is useful for observability in that it helps the user debug what happened.
