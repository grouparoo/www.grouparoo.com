This is a big update to add the concept of events. Grouparoo loves connecting to sources like data wwarehouses, but events (like pageviews) are still important.

Now, there is an API and a Javascript client to report pageviews and identify users. These events are saved in the Grouparoo database and linked to profiles. It's smart enough to merge profiles if it turns out the user was actually the same one.

Once you have those events, you can create a source that makes profile properties from them. For example, let's add how many page views a user has had. And another one for what they last looked at. Of course, you can use those when creating groups and syncing to destinations.

With events, we are excited to help you get an even picture of your customer.
