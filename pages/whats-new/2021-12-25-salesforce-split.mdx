Starting with Grouparoo v0.7.8, common use cases for Salesforce, such as exporting "Accounts" and "Contacts", have been separated out into their own Destinations to make configuring these use cases easier than ever. Of course, you still have the power and flexibility of exporting custom objects by using the existing "Objects" Destination type.
