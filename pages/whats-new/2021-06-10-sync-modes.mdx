All of Grouparoo's Destinations now have support for sync modes!

This new concept allows you to have more control over what exactly happens when Grouparoo syncs data to Destinations and how it interacts with pre-existing data.

Learn more about what you can do with [Sync Modes](https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/sync-modes) or check out [how you can use them in Grouparoo](https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/using-sync-modes).
