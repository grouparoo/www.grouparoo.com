You can now add Mailchimp as a Source. Some of our users were asking for a way to identify users in Mailchimp using a property besides email, so now you can import users from Mailchimp into Grouparoo and identify them using any unique identifier that exists in Mailchimp. You can also pull in open rates and click rates on a profile.
