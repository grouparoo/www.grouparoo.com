Facebook custom audiences can now be a Grouparoo destination. This means that you can sync your customer information to Facebook in order to target ads or exclude them from campaigns.

A common use case is to automate teaching Facebook about your high-value users. This custom audience can be then used to create a lookalike audience for similar users.
