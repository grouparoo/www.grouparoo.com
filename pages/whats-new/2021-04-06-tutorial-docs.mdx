Grouparoo has launched a new section in our documentation: [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials)!

This new section will be focused on providing you with real-world, step-by-step examples that you can follow to become more familiar with Grouparoo.

We currently have a single tutorial on [Declarative Sync](/docs/tutorials/app-example-config), which walks through a basic e-commerce example that syncs data between a SQLite product database Source and Mailchimp as the Destination.
