Grouparoo can now import data from MongoDB!

The `@grouparoo/mongo` plugin can be added to your project to import Profiles and Properties from your MongoDB application database. MongoDB is the first NoSQL database supported by Grouparoo, and all of the same Source features available for relational databases are available for MongoDB - including aggregation Properties, query Properties, and scheduled imports.

Learn how to install plugins by visiting [the Grouparoo documentation](/docs/installation/plugins).
