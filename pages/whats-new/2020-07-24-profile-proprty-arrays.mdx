Previously, profile properties could only be a single value. For example, `lastPurchaseCategory = "Toys"`.

Now sources allow you to create arrays, or lists of values. For example, `purchaseCategories = ["Toys", "Sports", "Electronics"]`.

These can be leveraged in group definitions. In this case, you can define group membership if someone has ever purchased something in the `Sports` category.

Destinations that support lists will also be able to sync the full property.
