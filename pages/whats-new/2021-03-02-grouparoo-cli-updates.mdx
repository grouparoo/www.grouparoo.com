Along with all the updates to support [declarative data sync](/blog/declarative-data-sync), the `grouparoo` command itself has been enhanced with a number of new features to make working from the command line easer. We've grouped them into 3 categories: Project Maintenance, Configuration, and Running Grouparoo (Development, Testing and Deployment). The Grouparoo CLI now supports a number of different workflows. For example, we've found that customers want to both `grouparoo start` and `grouparoo run`, depending on how they use Grouparoo.

`grouparoo start` boots up the Grouparoo application as a stand-alone service which will be constantly checking your Sources for new data via Schedules and exporting those Profiles. `grouparoo start` is best for Growth Engineering teams who are looking to sync data in real-time.,

`grouparoo run` is a one-off process which will look for new Profile data once, sync those profiles, and then exit when complete. `grouparoo run` is best for Data Engineering teams who want to run Grouparoo after they've populated their data warehouse with the latest data, and don't need to run Grouparoo again until that next update.

The Grouparoo CLI commands are:

**Project Maintenance**

```bash
# Create a new Grouparoo project.
grouparoo init [dir]

# Upgrade all Grouparoo packages to the latest versions.
grouparoo update

# Install packages defined in your package.json or add new ones. This is equivalent to npm install [package].
grouparoo install [package]
```

**Configuration**

```bash
# Generate a config file for an new object (App, Source, Property, Destination, etc) from a template.
grouparoo generate [options] [template] [id]

# Test and validate your code config. Doesn't write changes to the database. Optionally disable checking with remote Apps.
grouparoo validate (--local)

# Apply config changes to the database.
grouparoo apply (--local)
```

**Development, Testing and Deployment**

```bash
# Get the status of your grouparoo cluster.
grouparoo status

# Import and Export 1 profile fully and output a snapshot.
grouparoo sync <profile> (--no-export)

# Run the application and stop after every Profile has been imported and exported as needed.
grouparoo run (--web) (--destroy) (--no-export)

# Run the application. Keep checking for new and updated Profiles. This is equivalent to npm start
grouparoo start

# Empty the Profiles, Groups, and related data from your database.
grouparoo destroy
```
