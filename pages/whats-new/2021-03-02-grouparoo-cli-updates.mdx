Along with all the updates to support [declarative data sync](/blog/declarative-data-sync), the `grouparoo` command itself has been enhanced with a number of new features to make working from the command line easer. We've grouped them into 3 categories: Project Maintenance, Configuration, and Running Grouparoo (Development, Testing and Deployment).

**Project Maintenance**

```bash
# Create a new Grouparoo project.
grouparoo init [dir]

# Upgrade all Grouparoo packages to the latest versions.
grouparoo update

# Install packages defined in your package.json or add new ones. This is equivalent to npm install [package].
grouparoo install [package]
```

**Configuration**

```bash
# Generate a config file for an new object (App, Source, Property, Destination, etc) from a template.
grouparoo generate [options] [template] [id]

# Test and validate your code config. Doesn't write changes to the database. Optionally disable checking with remote Apps.
grouparoo validate (--local)

# Apply config changes to the database.
grouparoo apply (--local)
```

**Development, Testing and Deployment**

```bash
# Get the status of your grouparoo cluster.
grouparoo status

# Import and Export 1 profile fully and output a snapshot.
grouparoo sync <profile> (--no-export)

# Run the application and stop after every Profile has been imported and exported as needed.
grouparoo run (--web) (--destroy) (--no-export)

# Run the application. Keep checking for new and updated Profiles. This is equivalent to npm start
grouparoo start

# Empty the Profiles, Groups, and related data from your database.
grouparoo destroy
```
