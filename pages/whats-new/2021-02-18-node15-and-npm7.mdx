Grouparoo works on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12, v14, and now... v15! This means we are in a great position to support the forthcoming LTS release of Node.js v16, along with the current LTS versions of v12 and v14 for years to come.

Previously, due to the [`peerDependencies` changes](https://github.blog/2020-10-13-presenting-v7-0-0-of-the-npm-cli/) introduced by NPM v7, we could not initially support Node.js v15 (which ships with NPM v7). The `grouparoo` CLI tool has been updated to know how to work with both the old and new NPM behavior. We've detailed our [mitigation steps here](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/discussions/1270).

The ability to support Node.js v15 is also important, as it's the only version that is [natively supported by the new M1 MacOS computers](https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/apple-m1-js-memory-error).
