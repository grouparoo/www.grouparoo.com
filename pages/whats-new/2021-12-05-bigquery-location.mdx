Starting with Grouparoo 0.7.6, our [BigQuery integration](/integrations/sources/bigquery) allows you to specify your BigQuery dataset's location. This allows you to use Grouparoo to sync data from your Data Warehouse located in any region supported by BigQuery.

For more infofrmation on the available locations, please visit [BigQuery's location docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations).
