On the `/about` page, we now badge the version of your installed plugins. They will be successful (green) if your installed version matches the `latest`-tagged version of that package on NPM, and warning (orange) if they don't.

In this way, you can get a quick snapshot about if you are running the latest version of Grouparoo or not.

You will also get a notification automatically if you are out of date.
