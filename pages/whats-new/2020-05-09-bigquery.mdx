You can now connect your [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) data warehouse to Grouparoo, using it as a source for your profile properties.

This implementation adds all the same features as our other SQL sources like MySQL and Postgres. For example, you can write a custom SQL query to add a property. There is also the table source that allows importing data without knowing SQL.

You can also use all the built-in datasets that Google provides. That's pretty neat.
