Grouparoo supports declarative data models and integrations to continuously sync data to cloud-based tools. You manage data sync just like you would any other part of your stack.

By adding [declarative code as configuration](/docs/config/code-config), you can now use your normal development workflow. You test the configuration, check it into git, run it on CI, review, merge, and deploy.

Check out the [video](/blog/declarative-data-sync) and the [docs](/docs/config/code-config) on how to get started. We think it is a big leap forward in how data sync apps are created and maintained.
