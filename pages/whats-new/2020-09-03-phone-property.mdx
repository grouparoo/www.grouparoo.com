All profile property rules have types. Some of the existing types include `string`, `email`, `integer`, `float`, and `date`. We have added the `phoneNumber` type to Grouparoo.

Knowing the type allows Grouparoo to help ensure data validity, provide better options for filtering and group defining, as well as make smarter mappings to destinations.

As part of this, for example, we also now support setting the `phone` property in Zendesk.
