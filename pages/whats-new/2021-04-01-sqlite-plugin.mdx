Grouparoo [has a new plugin](/docs/installation/plugins): [SQLite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grouparoo/sqlite)!

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a lightweight database that holds its data in a single `.sqlite `file on disk. Up until now, Grouparoo has supported SQLite as its application database, but not as a Source or Destination for your customer data.

With this addition, you can now use SQLite as a [Source](/docs/config/code-config/sources) — to import your customer data — or a [Destination](/docs/config/code-config/destinations) – to export your Grouparoo Profiles and Groups.

This new plugin will make it easier to get up and running with real-world examples, as we'll demonstrate in future tutorials and blog posts. Stay tuned!
