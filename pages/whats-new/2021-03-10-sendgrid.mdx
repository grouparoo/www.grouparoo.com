We have added [Sendgrid](https://www.sendgrid.com) as a destination. Sendgrid is a very popular transactional email tool in the developer community, and they're starting to build more CRM-esque features into their offering. Our integration allows you to easily connect your product database (Postgres, MySQL) or data warehouse (Snowflake) to Sendgrid with just a few clicks or lines of code.
