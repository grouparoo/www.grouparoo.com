We have added [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) as both a source and a destination.

The most common usage will be as a source. You can use your Redshift data warehouse to populate profiles with properties to be used for group definitions and sent to destinations. Redhsift has two sources:

- Query: write your own SQL
- Table: no-code property creation

The Redshift destination, like MySQL and Postgres, allows you to write Grouparoo properties and group membership in order to leverage them in business intelligence and other tools.
