## Testing your Grouparoo Application

In order to help fit Grouparoo into the CI/CD tools you use today, Grouparoo comes with testing utilities to which you can use to build a test suite that ensures that the application is producing the Profiles and Groups you expect. Grouparoo relies on [Jest](https://jestjs.io) to provide expectations and snapshot testing. To enable Grouparoo testing:

1. `npm install --save @grouparoo/spec-helper jest`
2. create a `.env.test` file to store your test configuration.
3. Create a new test in a `__tests__` directory within your project
4. Write you test
5. Run your test with `./node_modules/.bin/jest [path/to/test]`.
   - You can wire up `npm test` to run this for you.

When you test your Grouparoo application, you'll be testing your configuration files, Apps, Sources, and Destinations. Ideally, you have a specific Profile in mind that you can fully sync. You can ensure that it ends up in the right Groups, and would be exported to the Destinations you expect.

## `.env.test`

When running tests, you'll want to connect to a test-specific Grouparoo database. This is a great time to use sqlite and mock-redis so you don't need to provision a "real" database for your tests. You can also safely disable the webserver and workers.

An example `.env.test` could be:

```bash
#############
## GENERAL ##
#############

WEB_SERVER=false
WORKERS=0
SERVER_TOKEN=test-server-token
GROUPAROO_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false

#############
## LOGGING ##
#############

GROUPAROO_LOG_LEVEL=info

###########
## REDIS ##
###########

REDIS_URL="redis://mock"

##############
## DATABASE ##
##############

DATABASE_URL="sqlite://grouparoo_test.sqlite"
```

In your test file, you'll be setting `process.env.DATABASE_URL = "sqlite://test_db.sqlite";` so the test will know which environment file to use.

## Writing Tests

In Jest, you can do expectation testing (`a` should equal `1`) or snapshot testing (the output of this method should not change between tests). Grouparoo supports both! The following example demonstrates a full suite which does both expectation testing and snapshot testing.

In this example:

- Your application is already fully configured with Apps, Sources, etc via code-config
- You have specified a test postgres or SQLite database to use via `DATABASE_URL` or a test-specific `GROUPAROO_ENV_CONFIG_FILE`
- `"person@example"` is a user in your source database that we are testing.

```ts
/**
 * @jest-environment node
 */

// Where should we load the test environment from?
// You'll probably want a similar config to your normal .env file, but with a different database and 0 workers
// Set before requiring @grouparoo/spec-helper
process.env.GROUPAROO_ENV_CONFIG_FILE = `.env.test`;

const { helper, relaxedSnapshot } = require("@grouparoo/spec-helper");

describe("snapshot", () => {
  // utility to start and stop the server within the test suite
  helper.grouparooTestServer();

  test("a profile snapshot can be tested", async () => {
    const { profile, snapshot } = await helper.getProfile({
      email: "person@example",
    });

    // You can do snapshot testing
    // `relaxedSnapshot` lets you skip time and UUID generated properties, but ensure everything else matches exactly
    expect(snapshot).toMatchSnapshot(relaxedSnapshot(snapshot));

    // Or you can test the properties of the snapshot directly
    expect(snapshot.properties.userId.values).toEqual([100]);
    expect(snapshot.groups.length).toBe(1);
    expect(snapshot.groups[0].name).toBe("People with Email Addresses");
    expect(profile.state).toBe("ready");
  });
});
```

## Testing Notes

- Unless you specify in your `package.json` or `jest.config.js`, You'll need to use magic comments to let Jest know that we are running a Node.js app (`@jest-environment node`)
