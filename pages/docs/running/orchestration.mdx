It's easy to integrate Grouparoo into your existing ELT/ELT process! There are 3 main ways tell Grouparoo when to run:

- Running Grouparoo directly via an Orchestrator
- Triggering Schedules via the API
- Triggering Schedules via a Query

## Running Grouparoo directly via an Orchestrator

Grouparoo can always be run via the CLI via `grouparoo run` or `grouparoo start`. Some customers may want to run Grouparoo via the CLI directly from their orchestrator a the proper time at the end of their ETL/ELT pipeline. For these use cases, we recommend configuring Grouparoo via code config and using the `grouparoo run` command.

This method of triggering Grouparoo is only applicable when self-hosting Grouparoo.

## Triggering Schedules via the API

Using the Grouparoo API, you can choose to run a [Schedule](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#schedule) whenever it is right for you. A common use-case is to trigger all of your Grouparoo Schedules to look for new records at the conclusion of a [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com/) transform step via [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) or [Dagster](https://dagster.io/).

The `/api/v1/schedules` endpoint can be used to trigger a Run for your Schedules. You can run all of them at once or provide a list of specific `scheduleIds` to run now.

First, create an [API Key]() with the `write` permission on `Sources`.

```bash
# Set Variables
GROUPAROO_HOST="http://localhost:3000"
GROUPAROO_API_KEY="ba05b18d9dae4acbb08799e7ef238f0d"

# Request to run all Schedules
curl \
  -X POST \
  -d "apiKey=$GROUPAROO_API_KEY" \
"$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/schedules/run"

# Request to view the available schedules
curl \
  -X GET \
"$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/schedules?apiKey=$GROUPAROO_API_KEY"

# Request to run a specific schedule
# The names of your schedules will be of the format (source_name)_schedule
# Provide IDs as a JSON Array
curl \
  -X POST \
  -d "apiKey=$GROUPAROO_API_KEY" \
  -d "scheduleIds=[\"users_table_schedule\"]" \
"$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/schedules/run"
```

More information about using [Grouparoo's REST API can be found here](/docs/support/rest-api), including how to generate API Keys. You can learn more about the specifics of this (or any) API endpoint that your Grouparoo instance provides by visiting the `/swagger` page on your Grouparoo instance.
