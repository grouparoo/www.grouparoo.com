It's easy to integrate Grouparoo into your existing ELT/ELT process! There are 3 main ways tell Grouparoo when to run:

- [Triggering Schedules via the API](#triggering-schedules-via-the-api)
- [Triggering Schedules via a Query](#triggering-schedules-via-a-query)
- [Running Grouparoo directly via an Orchestrator](#running-grouparoo-directly-via-an-orchestrator)

## Triggering Schedules via the API

Using the Grouparoo API, you can choose to run a [Schedule](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#schedule) whenever it is right for you. A common use-case is to trigger all of your Grouparoo Schedules to look for new & updated Records at the conclusion of a [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com/) transform step via and Orchestrator like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) or [Dagster](https://dagster.io/).

The `/api/v1/schedules/run` endpoint can be used to trigger a Run for your Schedules. You can run all of your Schedules or provide a list of specific `scheduleIds` to run.

First, create an [API Key](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#api-key) with the `write` permission on `Sources`, and then you can use the API as documented below:

```bash
# Set Variables
GROUPAROO_HOST="http://localhost:3000"
GROUPAROO_API_KEY="ba05b18d9dae4acbb08799e7ef238f0d"

# Request to run all Schedules now
curl \
  -X POST \
  -d "apiKey=$GROUPAROO_API_KEY" \
"$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/schedules/run"

# Request to view the available schedules
curl \
  -X GET \
"$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/schedules?apiKey=$GROUPAROO_API_KEY"

# Request to run a specific schedule now
# The names of your schedules will be of the format (source_name)_schedule
# Provide IDs as a JSON Array
curl \
  -X POST \
  -d "apiKey=$GROUPAROO_API_KEY" \
  -d "scheduleIds=[\"users_table_schedule\"]" \
"$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/schedules/run"
```

More information about using [Grouparoo's REST API can be found here](/docs/support/rest-api), including how to generate API Keys. You can learn more about the specifics of this (or any) API endpoint that your Grouparoo instance provides by visiting the `/swagger` page on your Grouparoo instance.

## Triggering Schedules via a Query

## Running Grouparoo directly via an Orchestrator

Grouparoo can always be run via the CLI with `grouparoo run`. Some customers may want to run Grouparoo via the CLI directly from their orchestrator as the final part of their ETL/ELT pipeline. For these use cases, we recommend configuring Grouparoo via code config and using the `grouparoo run` command. This will run all Schedules immediately when `grouparoo run` is started.

There are [flags which can be used to customize the run command's behavior](/docs/cli/run#run). This method of triggering Schedules is only applicable when self-hosting Grouparoo.
