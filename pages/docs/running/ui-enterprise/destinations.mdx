Destinations are the last step in the Grouparoo configuration process. That means you should have already configured at least one [App](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/apps), [Source](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/sources), [Property](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/properties), and [Group](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/groups).

Once you have all other items configuration, you're ready to send your customer data to Destinations. Destinations are the last piece of the puzzle. They are the place(s) you want to send your customer data so you can take action on your workflows. These Destinations can be email marketing tools like [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), or [Braze](https://www.braze.com/). Destinations can also be data tools like [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift) or [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/). [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

Here's how to send Records, Groups, and Record Properties to Destinations:

### Step 1: Choose an App

Click on _Destinations_ in the left-nav and then click _Add New Destination_.

Destinations are created using Apps. Next, choose the kind of Destination you'd like to create from the list of available Apps. The choices shown will be based on which Apps you've already connected. If you don't see the App you want to use, you can [add a new App](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/apps).

### Step 2: Set Destination Options

Once you've selected the type of App, the specific questions and settings will vary. Here is [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), as an example. Mailchimp has Audiences that each have a `listId`. You can choose the specific `listId` you'll want to set for this Destination.

### Step 3: Choose Groups

Now you can define what Groups and what Record Properties you want to send to your Destination. You can choose to send _All Groups_ or a specific Group to send. This Mapping defines which Records, or **who gets sent to the Destination**.

  height={654}
/>

### Step 4: Map Record Properties

Next you can choose which Record Properties you want to send to your Destination. Usually a Unique Record Property such as `email` or `user id` will be required so the Destination knows how to identify Records and to keep Records separate.

### Step 5: Choose Group Membership

Lastly, you can choose how Group membership shows up in your destination. This Mapping lets you decide how Groups are represented in your Destination. Often Groups are shown as Lists, Audiences, or Tags in these Destinations.

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done! Yay! ðŸŽ‰

You're all set! Your Records, Record Properties, and Groups are all synchronized in real-time across your Sources and Destinations. As your customers take actions, Grouparoo will automatically detect changes in your Sources, update Records and Groups, and send them to your Destinations.
