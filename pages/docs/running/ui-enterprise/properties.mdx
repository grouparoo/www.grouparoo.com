Now that you have a Source or some Sources ([see here if you don't have a Source](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/sources)), you can begin to define additional Record Properties. Record Properties are data values associated to the Records you have in Grouparoo. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Creating a Record Property

There are two ways to add Record Properties to a source:

### Option 1: Record Properties Page

Multiple Record Properties can be defined from the same Source. You can create new Record Properties from the Record Properties list:

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="New Record Properties"
  src="/images/docs/guides/new-record-properties.png"
  width={1808}
  height={846}
/>

### Option 2: Source Page

You can also create new Record Properties by going to a Source's detail page.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="New Record Properties Source Details"
  src="/images/docs/guides/new-record-properties-source-detail.png"
  width={1833}
  height={894}
/>

## Property Attributes

There are a number of options for how you can define Properties such as whether it is `unique`, whether the Property is an `array`, and as well as the aggregation method.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="New Property"
  src="/images/docs/guides/add-record-property.png"
  width={1817}
  height={964}
/>

## Next Steps

Once you have all your Properties defined, you're in good shape! You'll see Records being imported into Grouparoo. That means it's time to [put your users into Groups](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/groups) of users.

And once you have those Groups, you can [create a Destination](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/destinations) to export data from Groups. (Just remember to [create an App](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/apps) for your Destination.
