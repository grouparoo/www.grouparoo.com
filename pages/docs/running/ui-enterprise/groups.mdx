Once you have an App, Source, and Properties ([start with an App](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/apps) if you don't have any), then you're ready to define your Groups.

Groups are where the magic happens in Grouparoo. (It's in the name, after all!) Groups are a segment or cohort of Records. They are useful in that you can use Groups to target a specific set of users to [export to some Destination](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/destinations). You can have _Calculated Groups_ and _Manual Groups_. [See here](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Adding Calculated Groups

Calculated Groups add and remove Records automatically based on Group Rules that you define. Each Rule has several options for logically determining if a Record belongs in the Group. Those options are listed below, followed by a few examples.

### Rule Operation Options

Each Rule has an operator â€” a logical statement to filter records. A Record must match every Rule to be included in the Group.

Available operations depends on both the _type_ of Property and the underlying Grouparoo database (SQLite vs. Postgres). See below for a list of rules. (If in doubt, choose Postgres.)

<RuleOpsTable />

### Examples

Here are a few different examples of Calculated Groups and their rules:

#### Example: Repeat Purchasers

Group Rules:

- Records who have purchased more than once
- Records with an email

#### Example: High-Value & Abandoned Cart Recently

Group Rules:

- Records who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 30
- Records who have recently added an item to their cart
- Records with an email

<ImageInBrowserFrame

  alt="High Value"
  src="/images/docs/guides/group-example-02.png"
  width={1368}
  height={673}
/>

#### Example: High-Value Xhosa Speakers

Group Rules:

- Records with a language set to `xhosa`
- Records who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 50

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="High Value"
  src="/images/docs/guides/group-example-03.png"
  width={1827}
  height={671}
/>

## Adding Manual Groups

While a great deal of the value of Grouparoo comes from our Calculated Groups, Manual Groups are still valuable in certain circumstances. Manual Groups are Groups of records where you manually add or remove Records from the Group.

## Next Steps

Once you've grouped your users, you're ready for the last step in the Grouparoo configuration journey, [exporting Groups to Destinations](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/destinations).
