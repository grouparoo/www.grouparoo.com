You can adjust the settings of your Grouparoo application through the UI [once the application is running](/docs/cli/run#start). Use the sidebar menu to navigate to the Settings page.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="Settings Guide: Nav Link"
  src="/images/docs/guides/settings--nav.png"
  width={820}
  height={437}
/>

Adjust the settings as necessary.
