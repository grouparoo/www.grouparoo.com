Unlike our configuration objects, the easiest (and recommended) way to adjust the settings of your Grouparoo application is through the UI. You can do this once the application is running.

Assuming everything is configured as it should be, you can start the application server [using the CLI](/docs/cli/run#start):

    grouparoo start

Visit the application and then use the sidebar menu to view the Settings page.

  centered
  source="Settings Guide: Nav Link"
  alt="Settings Guide: Nav Link"
  src="docs/guides/settings--nav.png"
  width={820}
  height={437}
/>

Adjust the settings as necessary.
