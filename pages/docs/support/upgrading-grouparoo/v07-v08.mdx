Grouparoo v0.8 brings a user experience focused around the Models you build. It also brings several breaking changes. Learn how to upgrade from v0.7 to v0.8!

As always, begin by updating the packages within your Grouparoo project by [following the generic upgrade guide](/docs/support/upgrading-grouparoo#installing-updates) to bump your dependencies to `v0.7.x`.

**An example of a Grouparoo deployment being upgraded [can be found here](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example-config/pull/29).**

## Model-Centric UI

One major change in Grouparoo v0.8 is our new Model-Centric UI. Now, you're able to see at a glance all of the Sources, Properties, Schedules, and Destinations associated with a Model from a single dashboard. You can view a Sample record and quickly access the configuration pages for each of these objects.

## Migration Notes and Breaking changes

### Google Sheets:

Google Sheets now only supports Properties with an `Exact` aggregation method. If you have Properties from a Google Sheets source using a different aggregation method such as `Count` or `Sum`, they will no longer work with version 0.8.

### Property and Schedule Config Files:

Property and Schedule filters have been renamed to match the terminology used for group rules. If you have Filters set on Properties or Schedules and you have configured your Grouparoo setup using our Config UI, you will need to manually update your config files as follows:

- `"equals"` --> `"eq"`
- `"not equals"` --> `"ne"`
- `"less than"` --> `"lt"`
- `"less than or equal to"` --> `"lte"`
- `"greater than"` --> `"gt"`
- `"greater than or equal to"` --> `"gte"`

### Group Config Files

Group config objects have changed shape as well. The operation within the `rules` array is now unnested to match the layout of Property and Schedule filter objects. You will need to unnest as follows:

A rule config that looked like:

```
  "rules": [{
    "key": "status",
    "operation": { "op": "eq" },
    "match": "active"
  }]
```

Now becomes:

```
  "rules": [{
    "key": "status",
    "op": "eq",
    "match": "active"
  }]
```

### Manual Groups no longer supported

As of Grouparoo v0.8, Manual Groups are no longer supported. All groups are now configured based upon sets of Group Rules, rather than by manually adding Records.
