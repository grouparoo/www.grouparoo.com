Grouparoo v0.8 brings a UI update focused on the Models you build. It also brings several syncing improvements, and a few breaking changes. Learn how to upgrade from v0.7 to v0.8!

As always, begin by updating the packages within your Grouparoo project by [following the generic upgrade guide](/docs/support/upgrading-grouparoo#installing-updates) to bump your dependencies to `v0.7.x`.

**An example of a Grouparoo deployment being upgraded [can be found here](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example-config/pull/29).**

## Model-Centric UI

One major change in Grouparoo v0.8 is our new Model-Centric UI. Now, you're able to see at a glance all of the Sources, Properties, Schedules, and Destinations associated with a Model from a single dashboard. You can view a Sample record and quickly access the configuration pages for each of these objects.

## Airtable Plugin

As we continue to add to our list of integrations, we are pleased to announce a community-contributed Grouparoo plugin for Airtable in v0.8.

## Salesforce Plugin Export Types

Another big plugin update -- our Salesforce Plugin now supports three different Export types as a Destination.

Now, you can send your Grouparoo Records to Salesforce Accounts, Contacts, or Objects making it easier to get your data exactly where you want it.

## `Null` and `Not Null` Filters for Properties and Schedules

Our SQL Plugins got a new Filter on Properties and Schedules -- `exists with any value` (not null) and `does not exist` (is null). Now you can populate a Property based on whether or not another column in your Source is null.

## Migration Notes and Breaking changes

### Google Sheets Properties

Google Sheets now only supports Properties with an `Exact` aggregation method. The following line will need to be added to your Property config files if you use a Google Sheets source:

```
  "options": {
    "aggregationMethod": "exact",
    ...
  },
```

All existing Properties from Google Sheets sources created with the CLI or Config UI will need this migration.
//is there a migration path for people who used UI enterprise to configure?

### Property and Schedule Filters

Property and Schedule filters have been renamed to match the terminology used for group rules. If you have Filters set on Properties or Schedules and you have configured your Grouparoo setup using our Config UI, you will need to manually update your config files as follows:

- `"equals"` --> `"eq"`
- `"not equals"` --> `"ne"`
- `"less than"` --> `"lt"`
- `"less than or equal to"` --> `"lte"`
- `"greater than"` --> `"gt"`
- `"greater than or equal to"` --> `"gte"`

### Group Filters

Group config objects have changed shape as well. The operation within the `rules` array is now unnested to match the layout of Property and Schedule filter objects. You will need to unnest as follows:

A rule config that looked like:

```
  "rules": [{
    "key": "status",
    "operation": { "op": "eq" },
    "match": "active"
  }]
```

Now becomes:

```
  "rules": [{
    "key": "status",
    "op": "eq",
    "match": "active"
  }]
```

### Manual Groups no longer supported

As of Grouparoo v0.8, Manual Groups are no longer supported. All groups are now configured based upon sets of Group Rules, rather than by manually adding Records.
