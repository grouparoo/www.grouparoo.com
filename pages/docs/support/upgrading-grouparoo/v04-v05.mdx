pullQuote: "v0.5 introduces Grouparoo's Config UI, a streamlined method for building your configuration objects."
---

v0.5 is an exciting new release that introduces Config UI. This builds on the v0.2 that introduced [Code Config](/docs/config/code-config). Code Config provides the ability to configure your Grouparoo application using flat files to fit into your current workflows.

Config UI is a web application sits on top of Code Config to make it easier to generate config files for you. This is now the preferred way to configure your application. [See the docs](/docs/config) for more information.

This is a new feature that does not introduce any breaking changes. Therefore, the only thing necessary to upgrade is to [follow the generic upgrade guide](/docs/support/upgrading-grouparoo#installing-updates) to bump your application to `v0.5.x`.
