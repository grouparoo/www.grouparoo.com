Hello Grouparoo Community! v0.2 brings four major changes:

1. [Code Config](/docs/config)
2. [The Grouparoo CLI](/docs/cli)
3. [Support for writing tests for your application](/docs/running/testing)
4. UI Editions (coming soon)

## Migration Guide

See [this pull request](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example/pull/103/files), which contains the changes to the `app-example` project. This is a good example for upgrading to v0.2 of Grouparoo for your app. All of the changes required will be in your `package.json` file.

1. Install the latest version of the grouparoo command line tool: `npm install -g grouparoo`
2. Remove any references to `@grouparoo/email-authentication`. This package has been removed and is no longer needed.
3. `grouparoo install @grouparoo/ui-community` and `npm uninstall @grouparoo/ui` to add the Grouparoo UI and remove the old version.
   - Also remove `@grouparoo/ui` from `grouparoo.plugins` within your `package.json` file.
4. Remove the `prepare` step from `scripts` inside your `package.json`. This step is no longer needed and will speed up your install process.
   - Check the rest of your build process and remove all instances of `npm run prepare` that you might have, i.e. in a `Dockerfile`.
5. Change the paths for your `start` and `dev` scripts to remove the `/api` path per the example below.

   - If you are using Docker or another runner to start your apps, you may also need to make a similar change.
   - In a Dockerfile, you might change `CMD ["./api/bin/start"]` to `CMD ["./bin/start"]`

   ```json5
   "scripts": {
     "start": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && ./bin/start", // "api/" has been removed
     "dev": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && ./bin/dev", // "api/" has been removed
   }
   ```

The changes, in entirety, to your `package.json` will look similar to this:

Now you can install the updated dependencies (`grouparoo install`) and run your Grouparoo application (`grouparoo start`)!
