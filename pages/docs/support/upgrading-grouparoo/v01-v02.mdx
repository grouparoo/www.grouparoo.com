Hello Grouparoo Community! v0.2 brings four major changes:

1. [Code Config](/docs/config)
2. The Grouparoo CLI
3. Support for writing tests for your application
4. UI Editions

## UI Editions

Our UI is now offered in two separate packages: `@grouparoo/ui-community` and `@grouparoo/ui-enterprise`.

The open-source `@grouparoo/ui-community` edition is a everything an engineering team needs to successfully deploy and monitor Grouparoo to sync data. It includes the following features:

- Monitor the application.
- View-only objects like Properties, Profiles, Groups, etc.
- Trigger runs.

The closed-source `@grouparoo/ui-enterprise` edition is **everything a company needs to successfully empower all their teams with the data they need.** It offers everything in `@grouparoo/ui-community`, along with:

- Allow non-technical users to configure the Grouparoo server via the web.
- Provide a no-code way to create & manager Properties, Apps, Sources, Schedules, Destinations, Groups, etc.
- Manage permissions and access for these non-technical users, including Enterprise login, Team management, etc.
- Do analysis of your data and gain insights.

If you are interested in using the `@grouparoo/ui-enterprise` package, please [contact us](https://www.grouparoo.com/meet)!

## Migration Guide

See [this pull request](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example/pull/103/files), which contains the changes to the `app-example` project. This is a good guide for upgrading to v0.2 for your app. You wil want to do the following:

1. Remove any references to `@grouparoo/email-authentication`. This package has been removed and is no longer needed.
2. `npm install --save @grouparoo/ui-community` to add the Grouparoo UI and also add it to `grouparoo.plugins` within your `package.json` file.
3. Remove the `prepare` step from `scripts` inside your `package.json`. This step is no longer needed and will speed up your install process. Check the rest of your build process and remove all instances of `npm run prepare`, i.e. in a `Dockerfile`.
4. Change the paths for your `start` and `dev` scripts to remove the `/api` path per the example below. If you are using Docker or another runner to start your apps, you may also need to make a similar change. In a Dockerfile, you might change `CMD ["./api/bin/start"]` to `CMD ["./bin/start"]`

   ```json5
   "scripts": {
     "start": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && ./bin/start", // "api/" has been removed
     "dev": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && ./bin/dev", // "api/" has been removed
   }
   ```
