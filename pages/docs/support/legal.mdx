The Grouparoo project is composed of a number of plugins, each with their own software license. The open-source core (`@grouparoo/core`) is released under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, as are many of our plugins. Other plugins' have licenses specified within their `LICENSE.txt` file and `package.json`.

You can learn more by visiting https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/LICENSE.txt

From time to time, we will include assets or code from third-party sources.

- The code that Grouparoo depends on is enumerated within each package's `package.json` file
- Assets that Grouparoo uses are listed either in the package's `README.md` or `attribution.md`

All dependencies Grouparoo uses must be licensed under a non-viral open-source licence that allows for commercial use. We audit every dependency in every sub-project of this monorepo via [license-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker). The list of licenses we accept can be found [here](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/tools/license-checker/check).
