Grouparoo's REST API enables you to connect to your Grouparoo instance from an external application and return data in JSON format.

## What can you do with our API?

Grouparoo's REST API contains endpoints for over 25 topics -- everything from installing a Grouparoo Plugin to getting a list of all your Schedules. To see a full list of API endpoints, navigate to `/swagger` in the UI of your Grouparoo instance or run:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  '{{yourinstanceurl}}/api/v1/swagger' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

with your instance's URL.

## Using the Grouparoo API

### Generating an API Key

To get started using Grouparoo's REST API, you'll need to generate an API key. To do this, first make sure you are signed into an account with "write" access for API Keys. Then:

#### UI Method

1. Go to Platform > API Keys or navigate to `/apiKeys` and select "Add API Key".

2. Give your API Key a name. An API Key will be generated and you will be prompted to set permissions for this API.

  height={502}
/>

To learn more about what each of the topics can do in the API, you can access the Swagger Docs for the Grouparoo API by navigating to `/swagger` in the UI of your Grouparoo Instance or going to Platform > API Documentation.

#### Code Config Method

You can also generate an API key object with the [`grouparoo generate` command]. To do this, run

```
grouparoo generate apiKey {{yourAPIKeyId}}
```

This command will generate a config file in a new directory `/config/apiKeys/{{yourAPIKeyId}}.js` that looks like this:

```js
exports.default = async function buildConfig() {
  return [
    {
      class: "apiKey",
      id: "{{yourAPIKeyId}}",
      name: "{{yourAPIKeyId}}",
      apiKey: "API KEY HERE" // you can hard-code the API key you want to use, or source it from `process.env.PRODUCTION_API_KEY`
      options: {
        permissionAllRead: false, // Does this API Key have read permission to all topics?
        permissionAllWrite: false, // Does this API Key have write permission to all topics?
      },
    },
  ];
};
```

From here, you can update the name and permissions.

### Accessing & Testing the API

As Grouparoo can be self-hosted, every deployment of Grouparoo provides its own API documentation.
The Swagger docs for your API can be found by navigating to `/swagger` in the Grouparoo UI.

  alt="Generate an API Key"
  src="/images/docs/support/rest-api/swaggerdocs.png"
  width={820}
  height={530}
/>

The Grouparoo API can be authorized in 2 distinct ways: as a web user (with a cookie and CSRF token), or via an API Key. By default, when visiting the `/swagger` page, you will be authenticated using your existing cookie. You can switch to using an API key by clicking "Authorize" and entering your API Key (if pasting in your API Key, be careful about extra whitespace).

For example, if you want to see a list of all your instance's apps, you can run:

```
# Set Variables
GROUPAROO_HOST="http://localhost:3000"
GROUPAROO_API_KEY="ba05b18d9dae4acbb08799e7ef238f0d"

# Make Requests
curl -X GET "$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/apps?apiKey=$GROUPAROO_API_KEY"
```

You can also make post requests, such as creating a team or adding team members. Assuming you have your variables set from the previous example:

```
# Set More Variables
TEAM_NAME="newTeam"

# Make Request
curl -X POST "$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/team?name=$TEAM_NAME&permissionAllRead=true&permissionAllWrite=false&apiKey=$GROUPAROO_API_KEY"
```

You'll get back an object that includes the team's id:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "id": "tea_377556ab-3a49-4b23-9044-fdaee77ed08f",
    "name": "newTeam",
    "locked": null,
    "permissionAllRead": true,
    "permissionAllWrite": false,
    "createdAt": 1628110919221,
    "updatedAt": 1628110919221,
    "permissions": [
      {
        "id": "prm_3882efbd-912a-4f48-b1ca-d0445dff972a",
        "topic": "apiKey",
        "read": true,
        "write": false,
        "locked": null
      },
      ...
    ],
    "membersCount": 0
  },
  "serverInformation": {
    "serverName": "@grouparoo/core",
    "apiVersion": "0.5.3-alpha.1",
    "requestDuration": 211,
    "currentTime": 1628110919419
  },
  "requesterInformation": {
    "id": "69f83d5c56f347bc656b022a4dfba659e1c2e53e-fc8845c5-94dc-4c70-aa15-f7d4ebaf2b58",
    "fingerprint": "69f83d5c56f347bc656b022a4dfba659e1c2e53e",
    "messageId": "fc8845c5-94dc-4c70-aa15-f7d4ebaf2b58",
    "remoteIP": "127.0.0.1",
    "receivedParams": {
      "name": "teamanem",
      "permissionAllRead": "true",
      "permissionAllWrite": "false",
      "action": "team:create",
      "apiVersion": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

which you can then use to add a team member:

```
# Set Even More Variables
TEAM_ID="tea_377556ab-3a49-4b23-9044-fdaee77ed08f"
MEMBER_FIRST_NAME="Taisto"
MEMBER_LAST_NAME="Walerian"
MEMBER_EMAIL="twalerian996@demo.com"
MEMBER_PASSWORD="abc123"

# Make Request
curl -X POST "$GROUPAROO_HOST/api/v1/team/member?email=MEMBER_EMAIL&firstName=$MEMBER_FIRST_NAME&lastName=$MEMBER_LAST_NAME&password=$MEMBER_PASSWORD&subscribed=true&teamId=$TEAM_ID&apiKey=GROUPAROO_API_KEY"
```
