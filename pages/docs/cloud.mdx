---


We're excited to share our Cloud offering! This guide should cover everything you need to get integrated
using your own repository with Grouparoo Cloud.

### Step 1 - Getting to your Project

Sign in to your [Cloud](http://cloud.grouparoo.com/) account, or create a new one.

#### If a new account
Follow the steps shown on Cloud to create an Organzation and Project.

#### If an existing account, but a new Grouparoo Project
Use the Project dropdown to create a new Project.

#### If an existing account, and project
You're set, follow the steps below!


### Step 2 - Acquring an API Key

Get your API Key. This can be found on your Project's primary page by clicking the Key icon near
the top right of the page.
API Keys are created with your project! Press the Copy button to copy the API Key.

### Step 3 - Creating your Github action

Note: Until Cloud is up and running, be sure to run the `grouparoo-infra-apps -> cloud-terraformer` Github action with your project's name!

The best way to interact with Grouparoo Cloud and Github Actions is as follows:

1. Create a github repo, public or private, to hold your Code Config. Do _not_ push your code config yet!
    * `mkdir my-code-config && cd my-code-config`
    * `git init && git commit -m "first commit" --allow-empty && git remote add origin <my origin.git> && git push -u origin main`
    * Make a new branch for your Code Config, and github action
    * `git checkout -B my-cloud-workflow-branch`
    * `grouparoo init .`
    * Use `grouparoo config` to setup your [Code Config](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config). Make sure to commit it!

2. Create the workflow for Grouparoo Cloud and push it up
    * `mkdir -p .github/workflows && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grouparoo/app-example-cloud/main/.github/workflows/grouparoo-cloud.yml?token=ABF42DR7YI226UKGVOEFI43BRZ346 -o .github/workflows/grouparoo-cloud.yml`
    * `git add .github`
    * `git commit -m "Adding the workflow"`
    * `git push -u origin my-cloud-workflow-branch`

3. Activate the Workflow
    * Go into your repository's Settings -> Secrets -> New repository secret
    * Naming is important, based on the template used for `grouparoo-cloud.yml` we need two keys: `GROUPAROO_CLOUD_TOKEN` and `GROUPAROO_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`.
        * The Project ID should look similar to `prj_<some-guid>`
    * Make the two secrets with the appropriate values from Grouparoo Cloud.
    * Create a pull request against `main` with your Code Config branch.
    * If you did everything right the CI action should run green!
    * Merge the PR.

4. Go checkout your running application
    * Merging should trigger the `Deploy` workflow.
    * Visit your Project's page in Grouparoo Cloud to be taken to the running instance
