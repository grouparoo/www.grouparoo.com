We're excited to share our Cloud offering! This guide should cover everything you need to get integrated
using your own repository with Grouparoo Cloud.


### Step 1 - Acquiring an API Key

As of right now you need to make a [Trial Request](/trial) in order to get Grouparoo Cloud access. Our Administrators should get back to you within a day to help get you set up in our system and ready to integrate! After the setup process you should have an API Key and a Project ID which are required for integration.

### Step 2 - Integrating your Code Config repository with Grouparoo Cloud

If you do not have a Code Config repository set up, please follow our [Docs](/docs/getting-started) on how to do so.

Once your repository is setup and pushed up to Github, go [here](/docs/cloud/repository-integration).
