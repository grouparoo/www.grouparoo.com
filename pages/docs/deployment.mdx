Congratulations, you have made it!

You've installed, configured, run, tested, tinkered, and now you're ready to deploy Grouparoo to production. With just a few more steps, you'll have all your customer data in all the right places!

## Before You Deploy

Before you deploy, it's important to understand [Grouparoo's deployment topology](/docs/support/network), [environment variables](/docs/support/environment), and [how to secure your Grouparoo cluster](/docs/support/security).

You can see a number of example projects which contain additional ways to deploy Grouparoo to various platforms at [https://github.com/grouparoo/app-examples](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-examples), or choose a project from the navigation to learn more.
