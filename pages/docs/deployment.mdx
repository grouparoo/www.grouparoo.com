Woohoo! You made it!

You've installed, configured, run, tested, tinkered with, and now you're ready to deploy Grouparoo to production. Just a little more effort and you'll have all your customer data in all the right places!

## Before You Deploy

Before you deploy, it's important to understand [Grouparoo's deployment topology](/docs/support/network), [environment variables](/docs/config/environment), and [how to secure your Grouparoo cluster](/docs/support/security).

If you need a reference along the way, there is an example application available at [github.com/grouparoo/app-example](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example).

## Deployment Guides

When you're ready, find the appropriate deployment guide for your environment:

- [Heroku](/docs/deployment/heroku)
- [Docker](/docs/deployment/docker)
- [Kubernetes and AWS](/docs/deployment/aws-and-k8s)
