This guide will help you run the Grouparoo application on your local machine. At the end of this guide there are links to instructions on how to run Grouparoo on various production-ready platforms.

Grouparoo is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Grouparoo relies on a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) database and [Redis](https://redis.io) cache. Grouparoo is distributed though [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com).

This guide has 3 options for you to install Grouparoo:

- Deploy to Heroku
- Run locally with Docker & Docker Compose
- Run Locally with Node.js

## Deploy to Heroku

The simplest way to see Grouparoo in action is to deploy it to Heroku for free:

## Run locally with Docker & Docker Compose

Assuming you have Docker installed:

```bash
# in a new directory
curl -L https://www.grouparoo.com/docker-compose --output docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

Continue with installation details in our Docker installation guide.

## Configuring your Grouparoo Cluster

Grouparoo can be configured to work with your data in a few ways.

- You can use the Grouparoo web interface to configure your cluster visually. Learn more from our [user guides](/docs/config)
- You can configure Grouparoo programmatically. Learn more from our [code config guide](/docs/config/code-config).

## Deploying to Production Environments

Now that you've tried Grouparoo locally, it's time to deploy it! An example application which can be copied and deployed via Docker or Heroku is available at [github.com/grouparoo/app-example](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example).

First, learn more about [Grouparoo's Deployment Topology](/docs/support/network), [Environment variables](/docs/config/environment), and [how to secure your Grouparoo cluster](/docs/support/security).

Then find the deployment Guide for your environment:

- [Deploying with Heroku](/docs/deployment/heroku)
- [Deploying with Docker](/docs/deployment/docker)
- [Deploying with Kubernetes and AWS](/docs/deployment/aws-and-k8s.md)
