Grouparoo is an open-source project, and we may have a different model of support than you are used to if you are coming from a conventional SaaS marketing tool.

**We strive to respond to bugs, questions, and problems transparently in the open.** We believe this goal is important such that future Grouparoo users can find past questions and answers to help themselves, leading to a stronger and more informed community.

## Github Issues

If you are a user of the open source Grouparoo project, please open a new [Github Issue](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/issues/new/choose) describing the problem. Issues are public, so please only share information that you would be comfortable with other people reading. Never share passwords or identifying customer data. Choose "Bug Report", and you will be guided though the process. There is no SLA provided by Grouparoo, Inc. for resolving Github issues. However, any member of the Grouparoo Community, including other users, are able to see your issue and help you out.

## Paid Support

If you hold a paid Grouparoo subscription, please create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/issues/new/choose) to start the support process. We monitor Github Issues from your team/company, and will prioritize them according to our agreed upon SLA. We still would like to use your issues to build our community knowledge base. In the rare case that your issue pertains to a proprietary extension or non-public information, please email [help@grouparoo.com](mailto:help@grouparoo.com).
