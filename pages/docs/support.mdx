Grouparoo is an open-source project.  **We strive to respond to bugs, questions, and problems transparently in the open.** We believe this this is important so that future Grouparoo users can find previous questions and answers to help themselves, ultimately leading to a stronger and more informed community.

## Github Issues

If you are a user of the open source Grouparoo project, please open a new [Github Issue](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/issues/new/choose) describing the problem. Issues are public, so please only share information that you would be comfortable with other people reading. Never share passwords or identifying customer data. Choose "Bug Report", and you will be guided though the process. There is no SLA provided by Grouparoo, Inc. for resolving Github issues. However, any member of the Grouparoo Community, including other users, are able to see your issue and help you out.
