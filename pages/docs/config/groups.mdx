Now that you've created Profiles and Profile Properties, the next step is to create Groups. Groups are a segment or cohort of Profiles. You can have _Calculated Groups_ and _Manual Groups_.

## Calculated Groups

Calculated Groups add and remove Profiles automatically based on Group Rules that you define. Each Rule has several options for logically determining if a profile belongs in the group. Those options are listed below, followed by a few examples.

### Rule Operation Options

Each Rule has an operator â€” a logical statement to filter profiles. A profile must match every Rule to be included in the Group.

Available operations depends on both the _type_ of Property and the underlying Grouparoo database (SQLite vs. Postgres). See below for a list of rules. (If in doubt, choose Postgres.)

### Examples

Here are a few different examples of Calculated Groups and their rules:

#### Example: Repeat Purchasers

Group Rules:

- Profiles who have purchased more than once
- Profiles with an email

/>

#### Example: High-Value & Abandoned Cart Recently

Group Rules:

- Profiles who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 30
- Profiles who have recently added an item to their cart
- Profiles with an email

  height={414}

#### Example: High-Value Xhosa Speakers

Group Rules:

- Profiles with a language set to `xhosa`
- Profiles who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 50

  source="High Value"

  height={414}
/>

## Manual Groups

While a great deal of the value of Grouparoo comes from our `Calculated Groups`, `Manual Groups` are still valuable in certain circumstances. `Manual Groups` are Groups of profiles where you manually add or remove Profiles from the Group.
