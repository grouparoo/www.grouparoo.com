Groups are where the magic happens in Grouparoo. (It's in the name, after all!) Groups are a segment or cohort of Records. They are useful in that you can use Groups to target a specific set of models to [export to some Destination](/docs/config/destinations). [See here](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

### Step 1: Add a Group

To add a Group, use the link in the main navigation, which will take you to your groups list page. Click the "Add Group" button to add a new Group.

  alt="UI Config: Add Group"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/group--01-add.png"
  width={1832}
  height={629}
/>

This will take you to a screen where you can name the Group.

  width={1833}
  height={629}
/>

### Step 2: Configure Group

Groups add and remove records automatically based on Group Rules that you define. Each rule has several options for logically determining if a Record belongs in the Group.

After creating a Calculated Group, you will be able to define the rules for that Group.

## Examples

Here are a few different examples of Groups and their rules:

### Example: Repeat Purchasers

Group Rules:

- Records who have purchased more than once
- Records with an email

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Group Example #1"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/group--04-example.png"
  width={1202}
  height={661}
/>

### Example: High-Value & Abandoned Cart Recently

Group Rules:

- Records who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 30
- Records who have recently added an item to their cart
- Records with an email

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Group Example #2"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/group--05-example.png"
  width={1368}
  height={673}
/>

### Example: High-Value Xhosa Speakers

Group Rules:

- Records with a language set to `xhosa`
- Records who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 50

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Group Example #3"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/group--06-example.png"
  width={1827}
  height={671}
/>

<GeneratedConfigFile
  configDir="groups"
  docPath="/docs/config/code-config/groups"
/>

## Next Steps

Once you've grouped your users, you're ready for the last step in the Grouparoo configuration journey, [adding destinations](/docs/config/destinations).
