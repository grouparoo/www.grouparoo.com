Groups are where the magic happens in *Group*aroo. (It's in the name, after all!) Groups are a segment or cohort of Records. They are useful in that you can use Groups to target a specific set of Records to [export to some Destination](/docs/config/destinations). [See here](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

### Step 1: Add a Group

To add a Group, select your Model from the navigation bar and click the "Add new Group" button.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add Group"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/group--01-add.png"
  width={1071}
  height={800}
/>

This will take you to a page where you can name your Group.

  width={1076}
  height={800}
/>

### Step 2: Configure Group

Groups add and remove Records automatically based on Group Rules that you define. Each rule has several options for logically determining if a Record belongs in the Group.

After creating a Group, you will be able to define the rules for that Group.

  width={1074}
  height={800}

## Examples

Here are a few different examples of Groups and their rules:

### Example: Repeat Purchasers

Group Rules:

- Records who have purchased more than once
- Records with an email

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Group Example #1"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/group--04-example.png"
  width={1136}
  height={800}
/>

### Example: High Value with Recent Automotive Purchases

Group Rules:

- Records who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 100
- Records who have purchased in the last 60 days
- Records with the Automotive purchase category

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Group Example #2"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/group--05-example.png"
  width={1140}
  height={800}
/>

### Example: High-Value Spanish Speakers

Group Rules:

- Records who have an account value of 100 or greater
- Records with a language set to `spanish`

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Group Example #3"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/group--06-example.png"
  width={1142}
  height={800}
/>

<GeneratedConfigFile
  configDir="groups"
  docPath="/docs/config/code-config/groups"
/>

## Next Steps

Once you've grouped your users, you're ready for the last step in the Grouparoo configuration journey, adding Destinations.
