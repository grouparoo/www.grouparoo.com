Apps are typically the first types of objects that you will create. They help Grouparoo connect to a number of different tools, such as your databases, data warehouses, and other third-party tools. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

With [UI Config](/docs/config) running and registered, follow the steps below to configure your app(s).

### Step 1: Add an App

You can begin the process either from the home page or the dashboard.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--01-add.png"
  width={850}
  height={414}
/>

This will take you to a list of your current apps. Click to add a new app.

  alt="UI Config: Add App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--02-add.png"
  width={852}
  height={460}
/>

Apps are enabled by installing plugins. Fortunately, Grouparoo's UI Config helps you install plugins on the fly. Apps from installed plugins will have an orange badge and are ready to be installed immediately.

Everything else in the list is a plugin that can be installed by clicking on it. ([Learn more about plugins](/docs/installation/plugins).)

Choose the type of app you'd like to add. When you're first getting started, we recommend adding the app that has the majority of your customer data such as a data warehouse or production database replica.

  height={472}
/>

### Step 2: Configure Your App

Once you've chosen an App, add the connection details you'll need to connect to this App.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Configure App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--04-configure.png"
  width={820}
  height={444}
/>

<GeneratedConfigFile configDir="apps" docPath="/docs/config/code-config/apps" />

## Next Steps

Your Grouparoo application starts with apps. As you continue to configure your application, you'll want to remember to **always start with an app.** Want to add a new destination? Make sure there is an app to support it.

If you're just getting started, move on to create a source next.
