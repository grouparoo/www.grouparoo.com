Apps are typically the first types of objects that you will create. They help Grouparoo connect to a number of different tools, such as your databases, data warehouses, and other third-party tools. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

With [UI Config](/docs/config) running and registered, follow the steps below to configure your App(s).

### Step 1: Add an App

You can begin the process either from the setup page or the navigation bar.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--01-add.png"
  width={1016}
  height={800}
/>

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--02-add.png"
  width={1011}
  height={800}
/>

This will take you to a list of your current apps. Click "Add App".

Apps are enabled by installing plugins.
Fortunately, Grouparoo's UI Config helps you install plugins on the fly. When you install a new app, Grouparoo will install the plugin via NPM and add update your `package.json` and lockfile.

Apps from installed plugins will have an `Installed` orange badge and are ready to be created immediately. Everything else in the list is a Plugin that can be installed by clicking on it. ([Learn more about plugins](/docs/installation/plugins).)

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Installing App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--03-plugins.png"
  width={1015}
  height={800}
/>

Choose the type of App you'd like to add. When you're first getting started, we recommend adding the App that has the majority of your customer data such as a data warehouse or production database replica.

<Alert variant="warning" className="mt-4">
  <p>
    Because Grouparoo is installing the Plugin from NPM, you must be online for
    this process to work properly. That also means you should expect to see
    changes to your <code>package.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code>{" "}
    files.
  </p>

    If something goes wrong during the process, shut down the server and install
    the Plugin manually.{" "}

### Step 2: Configure Your App

Once you've chosen an App, add the connection details you'll need to connect to this App.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Configure App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--04-configure.png"
  width={1018}
  height={800}
/>

### Step 3 (Optional): App Refresh Query

App Refresh Query allows Grouparoo to scan your data warehouse periodically for new data using a query you define.

The following Plugins support App Refresh Query:

- [BigQuery](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-bigquery)
- [Clickhouse](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-clickhouse)
- [MySQL](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-mysql)
- [Postgres](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-postgres)
- [Redshift](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-redshift)
- [Snowflake](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-snowflake)
- [SQLite](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-sqlite)

These Apps will have an additional tab at the top of this page titled "Refresh". Clicking that tab will allow you to add a Refresh to your App.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add App Refresh Query"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--05-add-refresh-query.png"
  width={1012}
  height={800}
/>

Once you've added an App Refresh Query, you will be able to enter the query you'd like Grouparoo to use to check your App for new data. You can test your query to see what value it will return, and the click "Update" to save.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Configure App Refresh Query"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--06-configure-refresh-query.png"
  width={1012}
  height={800}
/>

Your App will now run all schedules for its sources anytime a new value is returned from this query. To implement App Refresh Query, it's helpful to have a single place you can check for updates in your database, often implemented as metadata written at the end of an ETL process.

## Next Steps

Your Grouparoo application starts with apps. As you continue to configure your application, you'll want to remember to **always start with an App.** Want to add a new Destination? Make sure there is an App to support it.

If you're just getting started, move on to create a model next.
