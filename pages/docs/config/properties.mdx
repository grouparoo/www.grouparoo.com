<Alert variant="warning">
  <p className="mb-0">
    Properties require a source. <a href="/docs/config/sources">See here</a> if
    you haven't created a source yet.
  </p>
</Alert>

Once you have a source, you can begin to define additional Record properties for that source. Properties are data values associated to the records you have in Grouparoo. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

### Step 1: Add Property

You can add a new Property from within a source and click the "App Property" button.

  alt="UI Config: Add Property"

  width={1822}
  height={693}
/>

### Step 2: Configure Property

There are a number of options for how you can define properties, such as whether it is `unique`, whether the Property is an `array`, and as well as the aggregation method.

  alt="UI Config: Configure Property"

<GeneratedConfigFile
  configDir="properties"
  docPath="/docs/config/code-config/properties"
/>

## Next Steps

Once you have enough properties to be able to define users, you can start thinking about [defining your groups](/docs/config/groups).
