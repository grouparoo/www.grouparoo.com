<Alert variant="warning">
  <p className="mb-0">
    Properties require a source. <a href="/docs/config/sources">See here</a> if
    you haven't created a source yet.
  </p>
</Alert>

Once you have a source, you can begin to define additional profile properties for that source. Properties are data values associated to the profiles you have in Grouparoo. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

### Step 1: Add Property

You can add a new property either from the properties list page, using the main navigation on the left of your screen.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add Property (Option 1)"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/property--01a-add.png"
  width={820}
  height={439}
/>

Or you can start from within a source and click the "App Property" button.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add Property (Option 2)"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/property--01b-add.png"
  width={820}
  height={440}
/>

### Step 2: Configure Property

There are a number of options for how you can define properties, such as whether it is `unique`, whether the property is an `array`, and as well as the aggregation method.

  alt="UI Config: Configure Property"

  height={440}

## Generated Config File

Grouparoo's UI Config will write a file to your local filesystem based on your inputs. That file will be placed in the `config/properties` directory in your Grouparoo project. You can further edit this file locally or through the UI Config.

## Next Steps

Once you have enough properties to be able to define users, you can start thinking about [defining your groups](/docs/config/groups).
