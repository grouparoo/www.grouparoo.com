A Source is a definition for how you pull data from an App into Grouparoo. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

A Model has two types of Sources:

- **Primary Source**: This is the source that provides the bulk of the data to the Model. You can only have one per Model.
- **Secondary Sources**: These sources supplement the data provided by the Primary Source.

### Step 1: Choose an App

To start, click on your Model in the left side navigation and click `Create Primary Source` (or `Add new Source` for Secondary Sources).

  width={1005}
  height={628}
/>

Choose the App you'd like to use to feed your source. The choices shown will be based on which Apps you've already connected. If you don't see the App you want to use, you can [add a new App](/docs/config/apps).

  width={1062}
  height={664}
/>

### Step 2: Configure Your Source

Once you've chosen the App, fill in the appropriate configuration values for your source. This will determine what information from the source gets imported into Grouparoo.

You will also need to indicate what makes each record in your source unique. This is a unique identifier such a `user id`, `uid`, or `email`.

When defining the Model's Primary Source, you will only need to select the identifier and
Grouparoo will generate a Property that will serve as the Primary Key for the Model where the source is located.

In the example below, the `id` column of the `users` table will be used to identify each unique record.

When defining a Secondary Source, you can map an attribute in the Source back to an existing property that ties it back to the Primary Source.

In the example below, the Pg Purchases source is being tied back to the Pg Users source via the `user_id` foreign key in the `purchases` table.

### Step 3: Add a Schedule

A Schedule defines how often Grouparoo will check your source for new data. When there are additions or changes in your data source, Grouparoo will pull that data in based on your Schedule settings.

You can choose how often Grouparoo will check your source for new data. You will also point Grouparoo to the column that indicates when a row in your users table has been updated, such as an `updated_at` timestamp column.

<GeneratedConfigFile
  configDir="sources"
  docPath="/docs/config/code-config/sources"
/>

## Next Steps

Once you've created a source, you'll probably want to [add more Record properties](/docs/config/properties) to it.

<Button
  href="/docs/config/properties"
  variant="outline-primary"
  className="mb-4"
>
  Add more properties
</Button>

  centered
  alt="UI Config: Configure Source"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/source--05-properties.png"
  width={1091}
  height={666}
/>

The real magic happens when you put your users into groups, which you can then export. Once you have all the appropriate properties, you'll want to [create some groups](/docs/config/groups) of users.

And once you have those groups, you can [create a Destination](/docs/config/destinations) to export data from groups. (Just remember to [create an App](/docs/config/apps) for your Destination.)
