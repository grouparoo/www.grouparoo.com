Grouparoo has a robust permission system you can use to limit access to your employees and applications. This feature is only available in our Enterprise edition. The Grouparoo permission model operates on Teams (for individual users) and API Keys (for applications). Consider making multiple Teams and API Keys for each use case.

The Community edition is configured for a single user, who has full control over the application.
