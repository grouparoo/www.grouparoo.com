Apps are typically the first types of objects that you will create. They help Grouparoo
connect to a number of different tools, such as your databases, data warehouses,
and other third-party tools. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts)
to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Generating a New App

To generate a new App for your Grouparoo application, run [the `generate` command](/docs/cli/config#generate).

For example, let's say you have a Postgres data warehouse containing your customer data. You can generate a new App like this:

    grouparoo generate postgres:app data_warehouse

Note here that `data_warehouse` is the ID for the App. An ID is always required when generating a config object.

This command will generate a file in your application directory at `config/apps/data_warehouse.js`. See below for more information about this file.

### List of Available App Types

Postgres is just one _type_ of App you can create. To see a full list of available types, use the `--list` option, filtered by "app":

    grouparoo generate app --list

This will give you something like the following:

    bigquery:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo bigquery App
    csv:app (id) - Config for a CSV App
    events:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo App based on Events
    google-sheets:app (id) - Config for a Google Sheets App
    hubspot:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo hubspot App
    mailchimp:app (id) - Config for a Mailchimp App
    manual:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo App with manual property values
    mysql:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo mysql App
    postgres:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo postgres App
    redshift:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo redshift App
    salesforce:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo salesforce App
    snowflake:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo snowflake App
    zendesk:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo zendesk App

### Installing New App Types

The list of available App types is driven by the set of plugins you've installed. If you installed your Grouparoo application using [the `init` command](/docs/cli/setup#init), you'll have a default set of plugins already installed.

You can see the current list of installed plugins in your `package.json` file, in the `grouparoo.plugins` section.

To install a new plugin, use [the `install` command](/docs/cli/setup#install). For a complete list of plugins, [see the Plugins doc](/docs/installation/plugins).

## Configuring Your App

The `generate` command attempts to make a _reasonable_ guess at the values in the config file it generated (in the `config/apps` directory). There are ellipses (`"..."`) in the places in which it couldn't make a reasonable guess.

The best practice when configuring an App is to read the comments, keys, and values within the generated file and fill in the appropriate values for your App.

## Validating & Applying Your Config

You can validate your config at any time using [the `validate` command](/docs/cli/config#validate):

    grouparoo validate

And you can apply that config (save it to your Grouparoo application's database) using [the `apply` command](/docs/cli/config#apply):

    grouparoo apply

Note that `apply` will run `validate`, but it's recommended to run `validate` on its own first, just to be safe.
