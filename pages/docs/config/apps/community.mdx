Apps are typically the first types of objects that you will create. They help Grouparoo
connect to a number of different tools, such as your databases, data warehouses,
and other third-party tools. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts)
to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Generating a New App

To generate a new App for your Grouparoo application, run [the `generate` command](/docs/cli/config#generate).

For example, let's say you have a Postgres data warehouse containing your customer data. You can generate a new App like this:

    grouparoo generate postgres:app data_warehouse

Note here that `data_warehouse` is the ID for the App. An ID is always required when generating a config object.

This command will generate a file in your application directory at `config/apps/data_warehouse.js` that looks something like this:

```js
exports.default = async function buildConfig() {
  return [
    {
      class: "app",
      id: "data_warehouse",
      name: "data_warehouse",
      type: "postgres",
      options: {
        host: "localhost",
        port: 5432,
        database: "...",
        schema: "public",
        user: "...",
        password: "...",
        ssl: false,
      },
    },
  ];
};
```

The shape of the object(s) returned by the function will look different depending on the type of App generated. More on this below.

### List of Available App Types

Postgres is just one _type_ of App you can create. To see a full list of available types, use the `--list` option, filtered by "app":

    grouparoo generate app --list

This will give you something like the following:

    bigquery:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo bigquery App
    csv:app (id) - Config for a CSV App
    events:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo App based on Events
    facebook:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo facebook App
    google-sheets:app (id) - Config for a Google Sheets App
    hubspot:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo hubspot App
    intercom:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo intercom App
    iterable:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo iterable App
    mailchimp:app (id) - Config for a Mailchimp App
    manual:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo App with manual property values
    marketo:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo marketo App
    mysql:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo mysql App
    postgres:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo postgres App
    redshift:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo redshift App
    sailthru:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo sailthru App
    salesforce:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo salesforce App
    sendgrid:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo sendgrid App
    snowflake:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo snowflake App
    zendesk:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo zendesk App

### Installing New App Types

The list of available App types is driven by the set of plugins you've installed. If you installed your Grouparoo application using [the `init` command](/docs/cli/setup#init), you'll have a default set of plugins already installed.

You can see the current list of installed plugins in your `package.json` file, in the `grouparoo.plugins` section.

To install a new plugin, use [the `install` command](/docs/cli/setup#install). For a complete list of plugins, [see the Plugins doc](/docs/installation/plugins).

## Configuring Your App

The `generate` command attempts to make a _reasonable_ guess at the values in the config file it generated (in the `config/apps` directory). There are ellipses (`"..."`) in the places in which it couldn't make a reasonable guess. In the example above, after generating a Postgres App, all but `database`, `user`, and `password` were pre-populated.

The best practice when configuring an App is to read the comments, keys, and values within the generated file and fill in the appropriate values for your App.
