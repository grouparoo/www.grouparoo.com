Models are how you define the shape you want your records to have in Grouparoo.
Once you've created a model, you can add sources and properties to that model to generate different record types.
For example, you may want one model that defines leads, another for customers, and another for site visitors.
See [Product Concepts documentation](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more.

With [UI Config](/docs/config) running and registered, follow the steps below to configure your model(s).

### Step 1: Add a Model

You can add a new model by clicking "New Model" in the navigation bar or "Add a Model" in the Setup page:

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add Model"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/model--01--add.png"
  width={2389}
  height={1400}
/>

### Step 2: Configure your Model

Give your model a name and select the type.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add Model"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/model--02-name.png"
  width={2179}
  height={1396}
/>

For now, that's all you need to do!

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add Model"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/model--03-overview.png"
  width={2192}
  height={1396}
/>

## Next Steps

Now that you've added a model, you can [add a source](/docs/config/sources) to start pulling data in to fill it and then define what [properties](/docs/config/properties) its records should contain.
