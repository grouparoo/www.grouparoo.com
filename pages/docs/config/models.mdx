Models are how you define the shape you want your records to have in Grouparoo. Once you've created a model, you can add sources and properties to that model to generate different record types. For example, you may want one model that defines leads, another for customers, and another for site visitors. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about Grouparoo's core concepts.

With [UI Config](/docs/config) running and registered, follow the steps below to configure your model(s).

### Step 1: Add a Model

Begin by navigating to the Models page from the navigation bar or setup steps page.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add Model"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/model--01--add.png"
  width={2856}
  height={1400}
/>

You can add a new model by clicking "Add Model".

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Add Model"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/model--02-add.png"
  width={2864}
  height={1394}
/>

Next you can give your model a name. For now, that's all you need to do!

<ImageInBrowserFrame

  alt="UI Config: Add Model"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/model--03-name.png"
  width={2872}
  height={1396}
/>

Currently, Grouparoo supports "Profile" models. In the future, Grouparoo will be adding more types of models to support additional types of properties and destinations.

## Next Steps

Now that you've added a model, you can [add a source](/docs/config/sources) to start pulling data in to fill it and then define what [properties](/docs/config/properties) its records should contain.
