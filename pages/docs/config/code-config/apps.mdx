Apps are typically the first types of objects that you will create. They help Grouparoo
connect to a number of different tools, such as your databases, data warehouses,
and other third-party tools. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts)
to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Generating a New App

To generate a new App for your Grouparoo application, run [the `generate` command](/docs/cli/config#generate).

For example, let's say you have a Postgres data warehouse containing your customer data. You can generate a new App like this:

    $ grouparoo generate postgres:app data_warehouse

Note here that `data_warehouse` is the ID for the App. An ID is always required when generating a config object.

This command will generate a file in your application directory at `config/apps/data_warehouse.js` that looks something like this:

```js
exports.default = async function buildConfig() {
  return [
    {
      class: "app",
      id: "data_warehouse",
      name: "data_warehouse",
      type: "postgres",
      refreshQuery: {
        query: "..."
        recurringFrequency: 6000
      }
      options: {
        host: "localhost",
        port: 5432,
        database: "...",
        schema: "public",
        user: "...",
        password: "...",
        ssl: false,
      },
    },
  ];
};
```

The shape of the object(s) returned by the function will look different depending on the type of App generated. More on this below.

### List of Available App Types

Postgres is just one _type_ of App you can create. To see a full list of available types, use the `--list` option, filtered by "app":

    $ grouparoo generate app --list

This will give you something like the following:

    bigquery:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo bigquery App
    csv:app (id) - Config for a CSV App
    clickhouse:app (id) - Config for a ClickHouse App
    facebook:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo facebook App
    google-sheets:app (id) - Config for a Google Sheets App
    hubspot:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo hubspot App
    intercom:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo intercom App
    iterable:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo iterable App
    mailchimp:app (id) - Config for a Mailchimp App
    manual:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo App with manual Property values
    marketo:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo marketo App
    mysql:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo mysql App
    postgres:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo postgres App
    redshift:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo redshift App
    sailthru:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo sailthru App
    salesforce:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo salesforce App
    sendgrid:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo sendgrid App
    snowflake:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo snowflake App
    zendesk:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo zendesk App

### Installing New App Types

The list of available App types is driven by the set of plugins you've installed.

You can see the current list of installed plugins in your `package.json` file, in the `grouparoo.plugins` section.

To install a new Plugin, use [the `install` command](/docs/cli/setup#install). For a complete list of plugins, [see the Plugins doc](/docs/installation/plugins).

## Configuring Your App

The `generate` command attempts to make a _reasonable_ guess at the values in the config file it generated (in the `config/apps` directory). There are ellipses (`"..."`) in the places in which it couldn't make a reasonable guess. In the example above, after generating a Postgres App, all but `database`, `user`, and `password` were pre-populated.

The best practice when configuring an App is to read the comments, keys, and values within the generated file and fill in the appropriate values for your App.

### Refresh Query

App Refresh Query enables Grouparoo to check your data warehouse for new data, and run all Schedules for that App if it finds any. The following Plugins support App Refresh Query:

- BigQuery
- Clickhouse
- MySQL
- Postgres
- Redshift
- Snowflake
- SQLite

For the best results, configure your query up to return a single row of data. For example, you might set it up as:

```
  refresh: {
    query: "SELECT MAX(updated_at) FROM meta_table"
    recurringFrequency: 6000
  }
```

This query would check every minute for a new `updated_at` value in a table called `meta_table`. The table you check with your App Refresh Query may or may not be one that you include as a [Source](/docs/config/code-config/sources).

If there are [Schedules](/docs/config/code-config/sources#adding-a-schedule) on this App's [Sources](/docs/config/code-config/sources) that you do not want to be run, you can add:

```
  refreshEnabled: false
```

to your Schedule's config.
