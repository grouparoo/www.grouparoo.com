Destinations are the last step in the Grouparoo configuration process. That means you should have already configured at least one [App](/docs/config/app/enterprise), [Source](/docs/config/destination/enterprise), [Property](/docs/config/properties/enterprise), and [Group](/docs/config/group/enterprise).

Once you have all other items configuration, you're ready to send your customer data to Destinations. Destinations are the last piece of the puzzle. They are the place(s) you want to send your customer data so you can take action on your workflows. These Destinations can be email marketing tools like [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), or [Braze](https://www.braze.com/). Destinations can also be data tools like [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift) or [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/). [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Generating a New Destination

To generate a new Destination for your Grouparoo application, run [the `generate` command](/docs/cli/config#generate).

For example, let's say you have configured a Mailchimp App with the ID `mailchimp`. You can generate a new Mailchimp Destination (from a table in the database) like this:

    grouparoo generate mailchimp:email:destination newsletter --parent mailchimp_app

Note here that `newsletter` is the ID for the Destination. An ID is always required when generating a config object.

This command will generate a file in your application directory at `config/destinations/mailchimp.js` that looks something like this:

```js
exports.default = async function buildConfig() {
  return [
    {
      id: "newsletter",
      name: "newsletter",
      class: "destination",
      type: "mailchimp-export",
      appId: "...",
      groupId: "...",
      options: {
        listId: "...",
      },
      mapping: {
        email_address: "email",
        FNAME: "firstName",
        LNAME: "lastName",
      },
      destinationGroupMemberships: {
        "High Value Customers!": "highValueCustomers",
      },
    },
  ];
};
```

See below for more information about this file.

### List of Available Destination Types

Postgres is just one _type_ of Destination you can create. To see a full list of available types, use the `--list` option, filtered by "destination":

    grouparoo generate destination --list

This will give you something like the following:

    facebook:destination (id, parent) - Config for a facebook Destination
    hubspot:destination (id, parent) - Config for a hubspot Destination
    intercom:destination (id, parent) - Config for a intercom Destination
    iterable:destination (id, parent) - Config for a iterable Destination
    mailchimp:email:destination (id, parent) - Config for a Mailchimp Email Destination
    mailchimp:id:destination (id, parent) - Config for a Mailchimp ID Destination. Note: Use the email destination unless you know you need this.
    marketo:destination (id, parent) - Config for a marketo Destination
    mysql:destination (id, parent) - Config for a mysql Destination
    postgres:destination (id, parent) - Config for a postgres Destination
    redshift:destination (id, parent) - Config for a redshift Destination
    sailthru:destination (id, parent) - Config for a sailthru Destination
    salesforce:destination (id, parent) - Config for a salesforce Destination
    sendgrid:destination (id, parent) - Config for a sendgrid Destination
    zendesk:destination (id, parent) - Config for a zendesk Destination

## Configuring Your Destination

The `generate` command attempts to make a _reasonable_ guess at the values in the config file it generated (in the `config/destinations` directory). There are ellipses (`"..."`) in the places in which it couldn't make a reasonable guess. In the example above, after generating a Postgres App, all but `appId`, `groupId`, and `options.listId` were pre-populated.

<Alert variant="primary">
  Note that the <code>appId</code> setting is where you would use the ID from
  the App you created (e.g. <code>data_warehouse</code>).
</Alert>

The best practice when configuring an Destination is to read the comments, keys, and values within the generated file and fill in the appropriate values for your Destination.
