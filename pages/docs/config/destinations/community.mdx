Destinations are the last step in the Grouparoo configuration process. That means you should have already configured at least one [App](/docs/config/app/enterprise), [Source](/docs/config/destination/enterprise), [Property](/docs/config/properties/enterprise), and [Group](/docs/config/group/enterprise).

Once you have all other items configuration, you're ready to send your customer data to Destinations. Destinations are the last piece of the puzzle. They are the place(s) you want to send your customer data so you can take action on your workflows. These Destinations can be email marketing tools like [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), or [Braze](https://www.braze.com/). Destinations can also be data tools like [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift) or [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/). [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Generating a New Destination

To generate a new Destination for your Grouparoo application, run [the `generate` command](/docs/cli/config#generate).

For example, let's say you have configured a Mailchimp App with the ID `mailchimp`. You can generate a new Mailchimp Destination (from a table in the database) like this:

    grouparoo generate mailchimp:email:destination newsletter

Note here that `newsletter` is the ID for the Destination. An ID is always required when generating a config object.

This command will generate a file in your application directory at `config/destinations/mailchimp.js`. See below for more information about this file.

### List of Available Destination Types

Postgres is just one _type_ of Destination you can create. To see a full list of available types, use the `--list` option, filtered by "destination":

    grouparoo generate destination --list

This will give you something like the following:

    hubspot:destination (id) - Config for a hubspot Destination
    mailchimp:email:destination (id) - Config for a Mailchimp Email Destination
    mailchimp:id:destination (id) - Config for a Mailchimp ID Destination. Note: Use the email destination unless you know you need this.
    mysql:destination (id) - Config for a mysql Destination
    postgres:destination (id) - Config for a postgres Destination
    redshift:destination (id) - Config for a redshift Destination
    salesforce:destination (id) - Config for a salesforce Destination
    zendesk:destination (id) - Config for a zendesk Destination

## Configuring Your Destination

The `generate` command attempts to make a _reasonable_ guess at the values in the config file it generated (in the `config/destinations` directory). There are ellipses (`"..."`) in the places in which it couldn't make a reasonable guess.

Note that the `appId` setting is where you would use the ID from the App you created (e.g. `data_warehouse`).

The best practice when configuring an Destination is to read the comments, keys, and values within the generated file and fill in the appropriate values for your Destination.

## Validating & Applying Your Config

You can validate your config at any time using [the `validate` command](/docs/cli/config#validate):

    grouparoo validate

And you can apply that config (save it to your Grouparoo application's database) using [the `apply` command](/docs/cli/config#apply):

    grouparoo apply

Note that `apply` will run `validate`, but it's recommended to run `validate` on its own first, just to be safe.
