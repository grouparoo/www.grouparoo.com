Unlike our configuration objects, the easiest (and recommended) way to adjust the settings of your Grouparoo application is through the UI. You can do this [once the application is running](/docs/cli/run#start).

Use the sidebar menu to view the Settings page.

<Image
  centered
  source="Settings Guide: Nav Link"
  alt="Settings Guide: Nav Link"
  src="docs/guides/settings--nav.png"
  width={820}
  height={437}
/>

Adjust the settings as necessary.
