Now that you have a Source or some Sources ([see here if you don't have a Source](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/sources)), you can begin to define additional Profile Properties. Profile Properties are data values associated to the Profiles you have in Grouparoo. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Creating a Profile Property

There are two ways to add Profile Properties to a source:

### Option 1: Profile Properties Page

Multiple Profile Properties can be defined from the same Source. You can create new Profile Properties from the Profile Properties list:

<Image
  centered
  source="New Profile Properties"
  alt="New Profile Properties"
  src="docs/guides/new-profile-properties.png"
  width={820}
  height={414}
/>

### Option 2: Source Page

You can also create new Profile Properties by going to a Source's detail page.

<Image
  centered
  source="New Profile Properties Source Details"
  alt="New Profile Properties Source Details"
  src="docs/guides/new-profile-properties-source-detail.png"
  width={820}
  height={414}
/>

## Property Attributes

There are a number of options for how you can define Properties such as whether it is `unique`, whether the property is an `array`, and as well as the aggregation method.

<Image
  centered
  source="New Property"
  alt="New Property"
  src="docs/guides/add-profile-property.png"
  width={820}
  height={414}
/>

## Next Steps

Once you have all your Properties defined, you're in good shape! You'll see Profiles being imported into Grouparoo. That means it's time to [put your users into Groups](/docs/config/groups/enterprise) of users.

And once you have those Groups, you can [create a Destination](/docs/config/destinations/enterprise) to export data from Groups. (Just remember to [create an App](/docs/running/ui-enterprise/apps) for your Destination.
