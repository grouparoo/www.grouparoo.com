Now that you have a Source or some Sources ([see here if you don't have a Source](/docs/config/sources/community)), you can begin to define additional Profile Properties. Profile Properties are data values associated to the Profiles you have in Grouparoo. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

## Generating a New Property

You are likely to have more Profile Properties than any other type of config object in your Grouparoo application. Because of this, creating them with the CLI can be a tedious venture. While we still recommend using the CLI, you can also generate a single Property and the duplicate the code inside one file or among multiple files.

To generate a new Property for your Grouparoo application, you can run [the `generate` command](/docs/cli/config#generate).

For example, let's say you have configured a Postgres Table Source with the ID `users`. And let's say you want to add a Property that calculates the lifetime value of each customer. You can generate a new Profile for that Source like this:

    grouparoo generate postgres:table:property ltv --parent users_table

Note here that `ltv` is the `id` for the Source. An `id` is always required when generating a config object.

This command will generate a file in your application directory at `config/properties/ltv.js`. Fill that file out with the appropriate values. The file will look something like this:

```js
exports.default = async function buildConfig() {
  return [
    {
      id: "ltv",
      name: "ltv",
      class: "property",
      sourceId: "...",
      type: "string",
      unique: true,
      identifying: true,
      isArray: false,
      options: {
        column: "...",
        aggregationMethod: "exact",
        sort: null,
      },
      filters: [],
    },
  ];
};
```

The shape of the object(s) returned by the function will look different depending on the type of Property generated. More on this below.

### List of Available Source Types

A Postgres table Property is just one _type_ of Property you can create. To see a full list of available types, use the `--list` option, filtered by "property":

    grouparoo generate property --list

This will give you something like the following:

    bigquery:query:property (id, parent) - Config for a bigquery Query Property
    bigquery:table:property (id, parent) - Config for a bigquery Table Property
    csv:property (id, parent) - Config for a CSV Property
    events:property (id, parent) - Config for a Grouparoo Property based on an Events Source
    google-sheets:property (id, parent) - Config for a Google Sheets Property
    mailchimp:property (id, parent) - Config for a Mailchimp Property
    manual:property (id, parent) - Config for a Grouparoo Property based on a Manual Source
    mysql:query:property (id, parent) - Config for a mysql Query Property
    mysql:table:property (id, parent) - Config for a mysql Table Property
    postgres:query:property (id, parent) - Config for a postgres Query Property
    postgres:table:property (id, parent) - Config for a postgres Table Property
    redshift:query:property (id, parent) - Config for a redshift Query Property
    redshift:table:property (id, parent) - Config for a redshift Table Property
    snowflake:query:property (id, parent) - Config for a snowflake Query Property
    snowflake:table:property (id, parent) - Config for a snowflake Table Property

This list is determined by the plugins that you have installed. [Learn more about Plugins](/docs/plugins).

## Configuring Your Property

The `generate` command attempts to make a _reasonable_ guess at the values in the config file it generated (in the `config/properties` directory). There are ellipses (`"..."`) in the places in which it couldn't make a reasonable guess. In the example above, after generating a Property for a Postgres Source, all but `sourceId` and `options.column` were pre-populated.

<Alert variant="primary">
  Note that the <code>sourceId</code> setting is where you would use the ID from
  the Source you created (e.g. <code>users</code>).
</Alert>

Other sections may be commented out but require some action by you. The best practice when configuring an Property is to read the comments, keys, and values within the generated file and fill in the appropriate values for your Property.
