</Alert>

Once you have all other items configuration, you're ready to setup your destinations. Destinations are the last piece of the puzzle, the place(s) you want to send your customer data so you can take action on your workflows. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

Here's how to send records, groups, and record properties to destinations:

### Step 1: Choose an App

Click on _Destinations_ in the left-nav and then click _Add New Destination_.

  alt="UI Config: Add Destination"

  width={820}
  height={494}
/>

Choose the kind of destination you'd like to create from the list of available apps. The choices shown will be based on which apps you've already connected. If you don't see the app you want to use, you can [add a new app](/docs/config/apps).

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Choose App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/destination--02-app.png"
  width={820}
  height={448}
/>

### Step 2: Set Destination Options

Once you've selected the type of app, the specific questions and settings will vary. Here is [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), as an example. Mailchimp has audiences that each have a `listId`. You can choose the specific `listId` you'll want to set for this Destination.

  alt="UI Config: Mailchimp Details"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/destination--03-name.png"
  width={820}
  height={456}
/>

### Step 3: Choose Groups

Now you can define what groups and what record properties you want to send to your destination. This mapping defines which records get sent to the destination.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Choose Group"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/destination--04-group.png"
  width={820}
  height={437}
/>

### Step 4: Map Record Properties

Next you can choose which record properties you want to send to your destination. Usually a unique record property such as `email` or `user id` will be required so the destination knows how to identify records and to keep records separate.

  centered
  alt="UI Config: Map Record Properties"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/destination--05-property.png"
  width={820}
  height={434}
/>

### Step 5: Choose Group Membership

Lastly, you can choose how group membership shows up in your destination. This mapping lets you decide how groups are represented in your destination. Often groups are shown as lists, audiences, or tags in these destinations.

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Choose Group Membership"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/destination--06-mappings.png"

  height={460}
/>

  docPath="/docs/config/code-config/destinations"

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done! Yay! ðŸŽ‰

You're all set! Once you have an app, source, a few properties, at least one group, and a destination, you have all the pieces you need to start syncing customer data!

If you're ready, feel free to move on to [running the app](/docs/running) in development, and then [deploy to production](/docs/deployment) when you're confident everything is working right.

UI Config offers an additional benefit of sampling data as you go. If you haven't added any sample records, you may want to check that out before moving on to running the app.
