    You usually want to have an <a href="/docs/config/apps">App</a>,{" "}

  </p>
</Alert>

Once your Records have all the data you need via Properties and Groups, you're ready to setup your Destinations.
Destinations are the places you want to send your customer data so you can take action on your workflows. [See this doc](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts) to learn more about the core concepts in Grouparoo.

Here's how to send Records, Groups, and Record properties to Destinations:

### Step 1: Choose an App

Select your Model from the navigation bar, scroll to the Destinations section, and click the "Add new Destination" button.

  width={1072}
  height={800}
/>

Choose the kind of Destination you'd like to create from the list of available Apps. The choices shown will be based on which Apps you've already connected. If you don't see the App you want to use, you can [add a new App](/docs/config/apps).

  alt="UI Config: Choose App"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/destination--02-app.png"
  width={1140}
  height={800}
/>

### Step 2: Set Destination Options

Once you've selected the type of App, the specific questions and settings will vary.

Here is [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) as an example. Mailchimp has audiences that each have a `listId`. You can choose the specific `listId` you'll want to set for this Destination.

  width={1139}
  height={800}
/>

In addition to any Plugin-specific Destination options, you will also be asked to choose a Sync Mode. Grouparoo supports 3 types of Sync Modes which determine how we deal with creating and deleting records for the Destination.

- **Sync** (`sync`): Add, update, and remove Records as needed.
- **Additive** (`additive`): Add and update Records as needed, but do not remove anybody.
- **Enrich** (`enrich`): Only update Records that already exist in the Destination. Do not add or remove anybody.

Not all plugins support all types of Sync Modes.

### Step 3: Choose Collection

Now you can choose which Records will be sent to this Destination. You can choose the members of a specific [Group](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#group), or all the Records that belong to the [Model](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#model).

<ImageInBrowserFrame
  centered
  alt="UI Config: Choose Group"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/destination--04-group.png"
  width={1132}
  height={800}
/>

### Step 4: Map Record Properties

Next, you can choose which Record properties you want to send to your Destination. Usually, a unique Record Property such as `email` or `user id` will be required so the Destination knows how to identify records and to keep records separate.

  centered
  alt="UI Config: Map Record Properties"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/destination--05-property.png"
  width={1132}
  height={800}
/>

### Step 5: Choose Group Membership

Lastly, you can choose how Group membership appears in your Destination. This Mapping lets you decide how Groups are represented in your Destination. Often groups are shown as `lists`, `audiences`, or `tags` in these Destinations.

<ImageInBrowserFrame

  alt="UI Config: Choose Group Membership"

/>

## You're Done! Yay! ðŸŽ‰

You're all set! Once you have an App, Model, Source, a few Properties, at least one Group, and a Destination, you have all the pieces you need to start syncing customer data!

If you're ready, feel free to move on to [running the App](/docs/running) in development, and then [deploy to production](/docs/deployment) when you're confident everything is working right.

UI Config offers an additional benefit of sampling data as you go. If you haven't added any sample records, you may want to check that out before moving on to running the App.
