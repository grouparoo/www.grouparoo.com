The `status` command will produce human-readable output like the following:

The `grouparoo run` command differs from the `grouparoo start` command in a few key ways:

- The `grouparoo run` command will terminate when there is nothing left to do. You'll see similar status to `grouparoo status` periodically displayed in the console.
- The `grouparoo run` command will run _all_ schedules exactly once. We will not continue to process them as time progresses. You can choose to run non-recurring schedules as well via a flag.

<CLICommand name="start" />

- The `grouparoo start` command is equivalent to `npm start`.

<CLICommand name="destroy" />

<CLICommand name="console" />
