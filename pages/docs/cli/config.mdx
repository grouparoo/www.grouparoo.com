<CLICommand name="generate" />

The generate command will create a template configuration file for you that you will then need to fill out.

There are many templates which you can use to generate from, depending on the plugins you have installed. You can use the `--list` flag to see available templates and filter the results. For example:

```
grouparoo generate --list postgres

Available Templates: matching "postgres"

  postgres:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo postgres App
  postgres:destination (id) - Config for a postgres Destination
  postgres:query:property (id) - Config for a postgres Query Property
  postgres:query:schedule (id) - Config for a postgres Query Schedule
  postgres:query:source (id) - Config for a postgres Query Source. Work with multiple tables and build custom queries for its properties.
  postgres:table:property (id) - Config for a postgres Table Property
  postgres:table:schedule (id) - Config for a postgres Table Schedule
  postgres:table:source (id) - Config for a postgres Table Source. Construct properties from the data in the table without writing SQL.
```

You are required to provide and `id` to the generate command. This `id` will be used in the file, to set the filename, and may be used by you later. For example if you generated an app called `data_warehouse`, in your sources you would set `appId: "data_warehouse"` to indicate those sources rely on the `data_warehouse` app.

You can learn more about the [configuration files here](/docs/deployment/code-config).
