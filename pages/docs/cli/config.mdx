<CLICommand name="generate" />

The generate command will create a template configuration file for you that you will then need to fill out.

#### `grouparoo generate --list`

There are many templates which you can use to generate from, depending on the plugins you have installed. You can use the `--list` flag to see available templates and filter the results. For example:

```
grouparoo generate --list postgres

Available Templates: matching "postgres"

  postgres:app (id) - Config for a Grouparoo postgres App
  postgres:destination (id) - Config for a postgres Destination
  postgres:query:property (id) - Config for a postgres Query Property
  postgres:query:schedule (id) - Config for a postgres Query Schedule
  postgres:query:source (id) - Config for a postgres Query Source. Work with multiple tables and build custom queries for its properties.
  postgres:table:property (id) - Config for a postgres Table Property
  postgres:table:schedule (id) - Config for a postgres Table Schedule
  postgres:table:source (id) - Config for a postgres Table Source. Construct properties from the data in the table without writing SQL.
```

You are required to provide and `id` to the generate command. This `id` will be used in the file, to set the filename, and may be used by you later. For example if you generated an app called `data_warehouse`, in your sources you would set `appId: "data_warehouse"` to indicate those sources rely on the `data_warehouse` app.

You can learn more about the [configuration files here](/docs/deployment/code-config).

#### Complex Generation

Certain plugins may provide additional complex generation options to help you generate many objects at once. For example, if you have a valid [`App`](/docs/config/apps) already configured and applied, Grouparoo can inspect that App and generate a Source and Properties automatically for you. Complex generation is signified by using the `--from` flag, and potentially the `--with`, `--mapping` and `--high-water-mark` flags as well.

For example, the `@grouparoo/postgres`, `@grouparoo/mysql`,`@grouparoo/redshift`, `@grouparoo/bigquery` and `@grouparoo/snowflake` sources all support complex source generation:

```bash
# first, make an App
grouparoo generate postgres:app data_warehouse
# (fill out the App config)
grouparoo apply

# Then generate the Source, Schedule, and Properties all at once
grouparoo generate postgres:table:source users_table \
  --parent data_warehouse \
  --from users \ # The table to use
  --with id,first_name,email,last_name \  # The columns to make into properties (default *)
  --mapping 'id=user_id' \ # How the mapping should shake out + Bootstrapping if the column is in the `--with` list
  --high-water-mark updated_at
```

The above commands would create a Source, Schedule, and 4 Properties.
