## Overview

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is a Google-run serverless, scalable, cloud-based data warehouse. It is built to support analysis and has built-in machine learning capabilities. Specifically, BigQuery is designed to help companies look for insights using very large datasets. Grouparoo's BigQuery Plugin enables you to import data from one or more BigQuery databases. You can use Grouparoo to sync data from BigQuery to any of the Destinations we provide plugins for.

### Sources

<table className="docTable">
  <tablebody>
    <tr>
      <td>Source Name</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="#bigquery-import-table">
          <strong>BigQuery Import Table</strong>
        </a>
      </td>
      <td>Import or update Records from a Bigquery database table.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="#bigquery-import-query">
          <strong>BigQuery Import Query</strong>
        </a>
      </td>
      <td>Import or update records via a custom Bigquery query.</td>
    </tr>
  </tablebody>
</table>

## Setup

In order to use BigQuery, you’ll need to enable it as a service in your Google Cloud project. Create a service account which will be the source for a Client Email Address and Private key you will need to configure the initial connection for a BigQuery App in Grouparoo.

## App

To connect BigQuery to Grouparoo, you [create an App](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/apps) to tell Grouparoo how to connect to BigQuery. This specifies the connection details for the database you want to sync data to or from.

### App Options

In Grouparoo, provide the options that best describe how you would like to connect to BigQuery.

      </td>
      <td>
        Email of service account. This will follow the pattern of the helper
        text pre-populated in the field and is generated by Google when you
        create a service account for this project.

        Region or multi-region code of your dataset. ("US", "EU", "asia-east1",
        etc.) This field is required for datasets outside the US.

## BigQuery Import Table

This type of Source is a [Table Source](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#table-source). It reads from a single schema or table in your BigQuery database using a primary or foreign key. Properties are generated from this table from row values or aggregations of row values.

## Schedule

[Create a schedule](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/sources#step-4-add-a-schedule) to actively pull new data from this BigQuery table. If the recurring option is not selected, you are creating a one-time sync. There are also options to confirm records exist when running a schedule and to enable refresh. When Recurring is selected, you will see a field for entering the frequency, in minutes, of recurrence.

      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>column</strong> (required)
      </td>
      <td>
        Select which column Grouparoo should check to look for new data. Often,
        this would be a column like “UPDATED_AT” - Grouparoo remembers the most
        recent values so it can be based on an incremental count as well.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tablebody>
</table>

#### Filters

If there is a subset of rows data you want to specifically include or exclude from your Postgres database table, create a filter.

### Properties

Properties populate your Records with data from your Postgres table based on table columns. [Create a Property](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/properties) to be able to use row data in Grouparoo.

        of aggregation methods for table sources.

    </tr>
  </tablebody>

#### Filters

If there is a subset of data for a specific primary or foreign key you want to include from your database table, create a filter.

## BigQuery Import Query

A Query Source works differently than a table-based source in that there are no options to choose in setting up the connection to this type of source. A Query Source is a more flexible way to build properties.

This type of Source provides the ability to write custom SQL code to extract data from one or more tables and import the result into Grouparoo.
