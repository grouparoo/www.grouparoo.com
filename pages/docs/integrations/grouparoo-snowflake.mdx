## Overview

[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a popular cloud computing-based data warehousing solution. It is built to support storage, processing, and analysis. Specifically, Snowflake is designed to help companies manage and look for insights provided by large datasets. You can use Grouparoo to sync data from Snowflake to any of the Destinations we provide plugins for.

## Setup

In order to use Snowflake, you’ll need a Snowflake account. Your account name can be found in the URL when you are logged into Snowflake. It will consist of at least two parts. There will be a third part if you use either Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services as your Cloud provider. The first part is a unique alphanumeric identifier, the second part is a regional designation, and the optional third part will indicate the cloud service provider. For those using Snowflake’s cloud, this will not be part of the Account name needed to set up a connection.

## App

To connect Snowflake to Grouparoo, you [create an App](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/apps) to tell Grouparoo how to connect to Snowflake. This specifies the connection details for the database you want to sync data to or from.

### App Options

In Grouparoo, provide the options that best describe how you would like to connect to Snowflake.

      <td>
        <strong>Account </strong>(required)
      </td>
      <td>
        The full name of the account (provided by Snowflake). It is the
        subdomain you use to access Snowflake.

    <tr>

        <strong>Schema</strong>
      </td>

        The Snowflake schema. This field will default to ‘PUBLIC’ if not
        manually set to a different schema.

## Snowflake Import Table

This source reads from a single schema or table in your Snowflake database using a primary or foreign key. Properties are generated from this table from row values or aggregations of row values.

### Options

There is one required option to select for this type of Source.

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")

<table className="docTable">
  <tablebody>
    <tr>
      <td>Option Name</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Table</strong> (required)
      </td>
      <td>The table to scan</td>
    </tr>
  </tablebody>
</table>

### Mapping

![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")

## Schedule

[Create a schedule](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/sources#step-4-add-a-schedule) to actively pull new data from this Snowflake table. If the recurring option is not selected, you are creating a one-time sync. There are also options to confirm records exist when running a schedule and to enable refresh. When Recurring is selected, you will see a field for entering the frequency, in minutes, of recurrence.

#### Options

![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")

<table className="docTable">
  <tablebody>
    <tr>
      <td>Option Name</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>column</strong> (required)
      </td>
      <td>
        Select which column Grouparoo should check to look for new data. Often,
        this would be a column like “UPDATED_AT” or a kind of time-stamp.
        Grouparoo remembers the most recent values so it can be based on an
        incremental count as well.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tablebody>
</table>

#### Filters

If there is a subset of rows data you want to specifically include or exclude from your Snowflake database table, create a filter.

### Properties

Properties populate your Records with data from your Snowflake table based on table columns. [Create a Property](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/properties) to be able to use row data in Grouparoo.

        Property.

        <strong>Aggregation Method</strong> (required)

        Aggregation methods determine how to use the row values in the table.

        </a>{" "}
        of aggregation methods for table sources.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tablebody>
</table>

#### Filters

If there is a subset of data for a specific primary or foreign key you want to include from your database table, create a filter and only rows matching your criteria will be imported.

## Snowflake Import Query

A Query Source works differently than a table-based source in that there are no options to choose in setting up the connection to this type of source. A Query Source is a more flexible way to build properties.

This type of Source provides the ability to write custom SQL code to extract data from one or more tables and import the result into Grouparoo.
