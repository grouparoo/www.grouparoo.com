## Overview

[Close.io](https://www.close.com/) is a CRM that allows marketing teams to focus on customer communication and makes an automatic record of all activities associated with customers and leads. Companies can use Grouparoo to sync from their data warehouse to Close.io in order to drive a marketing strategy that is data-informed and automatic.

## Setup

In order to sync data to Close.io with Grouparoo, you will need a Close.io account.

During configuration of this integration using Grouparoo’s UI, you will need an API key. API key management can be found at [app.close.com/settings/api](https://app.close.com/settings/api/). The API dashboard allows you to create new keys and tracks their usage. However, you will only be able to see the API key and copy/paste it during creation.

You’ll also want to be aware of the different destinations available to you. You can export to Leads or to Contacts. Leads are generally seen as companies. Each Lead may have multiple associated Contacts, which are individual people. The way you structure your Model in Grouparoo will indicate which type of Destination you should use.

## App

To connect Close.io to Grouparoo, you [create an App](/docs/config/apps). This step will specify how Grouparoo can connect to Close.io with your account information to prepare for setting up a new Destination in Grouparoo.

### App Options

In Grouparoo’s UI config, you specify the options to connect to Close.io and test the connection. Be sure to click Update after testing to save the new configuration.

## Close.io Export Leads

This Destination allows you to sync your Grouparoo Records to Leads in Close.io.

When you [create a Destination](/docs/config/destinations) you make choices about what data to sync.

### Sync Modes

- **Sync**: Add, update, and remove Close.io Leads as needed.This option looks for new records, changes to existing records, and deletions.
- **Additive**: Add and update Close.io Leads as needed, but do not remove anybody. This option looks for new Leads to add to Close.io and changes to existing Leads, but does not keep track of deletions.
- **Enrich**: Only update those Leads that already exist in Close.io. Do not add or remove Leads.

### Destination Options

Some types of Destinations require further clarification about how data should sync. In the case of Close.io, there are no further Options to configure before moving on to mapping Record Data.
