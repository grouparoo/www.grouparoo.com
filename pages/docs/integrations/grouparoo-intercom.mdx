Grouparoo's [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) Integration enables you to export contacts and tags to Intercom.

## Overview

Intercom is a messaging platform for customer communications. You can use Intercom to stay in touch with customers. Grouparoo can help you to sync data from your warehouse to Intercom easily.

### Destinations

<table className="docTable">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Destination Name</td>
      <td>Destination Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intercom Export Contacts</td>
      <td>
        This Destination exports Grouparoo Records to Contacts in an Intercom
        account.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Setup

You will need an Intercom account and an access token to sync data to Intercom.

To find your access tokens, or create a new one, visit the [Intercom Developer Hub](https://developers.intercom.com/) and navigate to **Your Apps**. Choose an existing app or add a new one with internal integration (this means you are not publishing your app to the marketplace). From here, you should be able to copy an access token from the Authentication page for setting up your Intercom App in the Grouparoo UI.

## App

To connect Intercom to Grouparoo, you [create an App](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/apps) to tell Grouparoo how to connect to Intercom. This specifies the account used for any Destinations.

### App Options

In Grouparoo, you specify the options to connect to Intercom.

  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Access Token</strong> (required)
    </td>
    <td>Access token from your private app in the developer hub.</td>
  </tr>

## Intercom Export Contacts

This Destination enables you to sync your Grouparoo Records to Contacts in Intercom as either Users, Leads, or a dynamic combination of both depending on data.

Companies use Grouparoo to keep their Intercom Contacts up-to-date in order to communicate with their customers through a wide array of channels using one tool.

To [create a Destination](/docs/config/destinations), you make choices about what data to sync.

### Sync Modes

A Destination’s sync mode determines what to update in a Destination. The following are supported by Intercom:

- **Sync**: Add, update, and remove Intercom Contacts as needed.This option looks for new records, changes to existing records, and deletions.
- **Additive**: Add and update Intercom Contacts as needed, but do not remove anybody. This option looks for new Contacts to add to Intercom and changes to existing Intercom Contacts, but does not keep track of deletions.
- **Enrich**: Only update those Contacts that already exist in Intercom. Do not add or remove Contacts. This option will only update existing Contacts in Intercom.

### Destination Options

To further clarify how Intercom should sync data, select how data should be synced.

</li>
<li><strong>Lead:</strong> This option created new contacts as Leads
</li>
<li><strong>Lifecycle</strong>: This option creates new contacts as leads unless there is an <em>external_id</em>. If the <em>external_id </em>for a contact exists, then it will be created as a user
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Removal </strong>(required)
   </td>
   <td>There are two removal options for Intercom.
<p>
<em>These options only apply if using a syncMode that can remove contacts.</em>
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Archive</strong>: This will add deleted users to an archive where they can be retrieved again.
</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>: This option permanently deletes a user record.
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tablebody>

### Record Data

Mapping Record Properties to Intercom User Attributes is the key to syncing data to Intercom.

In Intercom, User Attributes can be used to filter and create customer segments. You can also use Intercom User Attributes to qualify leads and trial users.

#### Required Properties

Some properties are required to be able to find or create the correct Contacts in Intercom.

In Lead creation mode, the only required field for mapping Grouparoo Properties to Intercom User Attributes is **email**. Otherwise, when using User or Lifecycle creation mode, there are two required fields to map: **email** and** external_id**.

- **email: **a Contact’s email address in Intercom
- **exernal_id**: set on a Contact with an identifier from your internal system, often assigned when they sign up for your service

#### Optional Properties

In addition to required fields, Intercom has many other User Attributes available to map data to including custom attributes that you have already created. Any of these can be synced to from Grouparoo Properties.

### Group Data

In addition to mapping Grouparoo Properties to Intercom User Attributes, you can use Grouparoo Groups to apply tags to Intercom User Records.

In Intercom, tags are similar to User Attributes and segments but they are used for grouping users and companies manually to highlight special features such as those requiring VIP support or those who are loyal customers. Tags can be synced using Grouparoo Groups.
