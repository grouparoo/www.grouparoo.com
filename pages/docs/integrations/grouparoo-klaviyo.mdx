## Overview

Klaviyo provides a solution for omnichannel marketing automation. Companies can use Grouparoo to sync data from a data warehouse to Klaviyo to support marketing teams with the most up to date information available.

### Destinations

<table className='docTable'>
    <tablebody>
  <tr>
   <td>Destination Name
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>

<a href="#klaviyo-export-profiles">Klaviyo Export Profiles</a>
   </td>
   <td>Export records to Klaviyo as Profiles
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tablebody>
</table>

## Setup

In order to sync data to Klaviyo with Grouparoo, you will need a Klaviyo account set up.

During configuration of this integration using Grouparoo’s UI, you will need a private API key and a public API key. Both types of keys can be found by navigating to **Account > Settings > API Keys. **The public API key is displayed at the top of [this page](https://www.klaviyo.com/account#api-keys-tab). It is safe to expose this public key. Below the public key, you can manage private API keys, which should be managed securely.

## App

To connect Klaviyo to Grouparoo, you [create an App](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/apps). This step will specify how Grouparoo can connect to Klaviyo using your account information. Having an App set up prepares you to set up a new Destination in Grouparoo.

### App Options

In Grouparoo’s UI config, you specify the options to connect to Klaviyo and test the connection. Be sure to click Update after testing to save the new configuration.
