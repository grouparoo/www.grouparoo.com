## Setup

You will need a Marketo account to start syncing data to Marketo using Grouparoo. Gather your Marketo Endpoint, Identity, Client ID, and Client Secret to prepare for configuration.

In Marketo, navigate to Admin > Web Services. This is where you will find your Endpoint and Identity, two pieces of information required to establish a connection with Marketo.

## App

To connect Marketo to Grouparoo, you [create an App](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/apps) to tell Grouparoo how to make the connection. This specifies the account used for any Destinations.

### App Options

In Grouparoo, you specify the options to connect to Intercom.

## Marketo Export Contacts

This Destination enables you to sync your Grouparoo Records to Leads in Marketo.

Companies use Marketo to organize a wide range of attributes describing behavior of marketing leads to better inform their marketing strategies.

To [create a Destination](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/destinations), you make choices about what data to sync.

### Sync Modes

A Destination’s sync mode determines what to update in a Destination. The following are supported by Marketo:

- **Sync**: Add, update, and remove Marketo Leads as needed.This option looks for new records, changes to existing records, and deletions.
- **Additive**: Add and update Marketo Leads as needed, but do not remove anybody. This option looks for new Leads to add to Marketo and changes to existing Marketo Leads, but does not keep track of deletions.
- **Enrich**: Only update those Leads that already exist in Marketo. Do not add or remove Leads. This option will only update existing Leads in Marketo.

### Destination Options

Some types of Destinations require further clarification about how data should sync. In the case of Marketo, there are no further Options to configure before moving on to mapping Record Data.

### Record Data

Mapping Record Properties to Marketo Fields is the key to syncing data to Marketo Leads.

Marketo‘s Lead Fields can be used for customizing marketing campaigns and analyzing lead behavior.

  height={440}

<br></br>
<br></br>

#### Required Properties

The only Grouparoo Property that is required to map to a Marketo field is **email**. Choose the Grouparoo Property that corresponds with the Lead’s email address.

- **email: **a Lead’s email address in Marketo

#### Optional Properties

In addition to required fields, Marketo has an extensive preset list of Marketo Fields available to map data. You can find these by scrolling through the dropdown menu in the **Send Record Property** portion of the form. Any of these can be synced to from Grouparoo Properties.

### Group Data

In addition to mapping Grouparoo Properties to Marketo Fields, you can use Grouparoo Groups to add Leads to Marketo Lists.

In Marketo, lists help marketers to engage with customers and business prospects more effectively.
