## Setup

You will need a Salesforce account in order to start syncing data to Salesforce. Your username and email will be part of setting up the App to connect to Salesforce. You’ll also need to be sure to have a security token set up before you proceed with configuration. .

In Salesforce, navigate to the link for Settings under your avatar. This will bring you to “Personal Settings”. Then use the side navigation bar to navigate to choose ‘Reset My Security Token’. You will need this token to establish a connection with Salesforce.

## App

To connect Salesforce to Grouparoo, you [create an App](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/apps) to tell Grouparoo how to make the connection. This specifies the account used for any Destinations.

## Salesforce Export Accounts

This Destination enables you to sync your Grouparoo Records as Accounts in Salesforce.

Companies use Grouparoo to keep their Salesforce Accounts up-to-date in order to manage client relations effectively.

To [create a Destination](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/destinations), you make choices about what data to sync.

### Sync Modes

- **Sync**: Add, update, and remove Salesforce Accounts as needed. This option looks for new records, changes to existing records, and deletions.
- **Additive**: Add and update Salesforce Accounts as needed, but do not remove anybody. This option looks for new Accounts to add to Salesforce and changes to existing Salesforce Accounts, but does not keep track of deletions.
- **Enrich**: Only update those Accounts that already exist in Salesforce. Do not add or remove Accounts. This option will only update existing Accounts in Salesforce.

### Destination Options

Some types of Destinations require further clarification about how data should sync. In the case of Salesforce, there is one required option to configure before moving on to mapping Record Data: Primary Key. This tells Grouparoo which Account field will be used to match up Salesforce Accounts with Grouparoo Records with a unique identifier.
