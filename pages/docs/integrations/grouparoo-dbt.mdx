Grouparoo's [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) Plugin enables you to configure Grouparoo within your dbt project using a shared config.

## Create a Grouparoo Project Within your dbt Project

To integrate Grouparoo within your existing dbt project, you'll want to follow our installation docs and make sure you initiate your Grouparoo project in the same directory as your
dbt project.

<PluginDocsInstallation plugin="dbt" />

<Alert variant="warning">
  Note that the main purpose of the dbt Plugin is to enable shared configuration
  of your dbt project. You will also need to install the Grouparoo Plugin for
  your data warehouse.
</Alert> Grouparoo's dbt plugin can support the following data warehouses:

- [BigQuery](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-bigquery)
- [Postgres](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-postgres)
- [Redshift](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-redshift)
- [Snowflake](/docs/integrations/grouparoo-snowflake)

## Orchestrating Grouparoo with dbt

You can use an [App Refresh Query](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#app-refresh-query) to orchestrate your Grouparoo Project based on dbt runs. An App Refresh Query checks for new data in a specific place in your warehouse as often as every minute. If new data is found, it will trigger all Schedules associated with that App. To get started with App Refresh Query, you'll want to make sure you have a single place for Grouparoo to check for data.

### Step 1: Set up a meta table

<Alert variant="success">
  This step is only required if you would like to generate a new `meta` table
  for Grouparoo to check for completed runs.
</Alert>

You can use dbt's [`on-run-end` hook](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/on-run-start-on-run-end) to generate a new table that is updated upon the completion of each dbt run.

At its simplest, you can do this by adding a macro to your project that generates a table that is updated after each run. Add the following line to your `dbt_project.yml`:

```yml
on-run-end: "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dbt_meta (last_run_at TIMESTAMP); INSERT INTO dbt_meta (last_run_at) VALUES (NOW());"
```

You can also generate a more complex `dbt_meta` table using a macro as seen in our [dbt example app](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example-dbt) project.

### Step 2: Configure an App Refresh Query

Assuming you have already installed a [Plugin](/docs/integrations#plugins) and completed the basic configuration for your [App](/docs/config/apps), you can now set up your App Refresh Query.

Start by heading to the `Refresh` tab on your App and select "Add an App Refresh Query".

  alt="UI Config: Configure App Refresh Query"
  src="/images/docs/guides/config/app--06-configure-refresh-query.png"
  width={1824}
  height={877}
/>

If you've set up a meta table in Step 1, you can enter the following as your query to check for any new runs with zero errors:

```sql
SELECT MAX(last_run_at) FROM dbt_meta
```

Otherwise, enter whatever query you would like Grouparoo to use to check for new data. You can read more about configuring an App Refresh Query in the [App Configuration Docs](/docs/config/apps). You can also set how frequently Grouparoo should run this query. By default, it will be run every minute.

Click "Update" to save your changes.

## Next Steps

That's it! While Grouparoo is running, it will now run run your query periodically to check for new data and trigger any associated schedules.

You'll also want to make sure you configure the other items in our [Configuration Guide](/docs/config) to get the most out of your Grouparoo instance and begin sending data to your Destinations.
