## SendGrid Export Contacts

This Destination enables you to sync your Grouparoo Records as Contacts in SendGrid.

Companies use Grouparoo to keep their SendGrid Contacts up-to-date in order to communicate with customers and manage client relations.

To [create a Destination](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/destinations), you make choices about what data to sync.

### Sync Modes

- **Sync**: Add, update, and remove SendGrid Contacts as needed.This option looks for new records, changes to existing records, and deletions.
- **Additive**: Add and update SendGrid Contacts as needed, but do not remove anybody. This option looks for new Contacts to add to SendGrid and changes to existing SendGrid Contacts, but does not keep track of deletions.
- **Enrich**: Only update those Contacts that already exist in SendGrid. Do not add or remove Contacts. This option will only update existing Contacts in SendGrid.

### Destination Options

Some types of Destinations require further clarification about how data should sync. In the case of Pipedrive, there are no further Options to configure before moving on to mapping Record Data.

### Record Data

Mapping Record Properties to SendGrid Contact Fields is the key to syncing data to SendGrid Contacts.

SendGrid’s Contact Fields can be either Reserved Fields or Custom Fields from a form. This helps companies gather helpful information about clients and prospects.

<br></br>
<br></br>

#### Required Properties

You must map a Grouparoo Property to the **email** SendGrid Contact Field. Choose the Grouparoo Property that corresponds to the Contact email from the dropdown menu.

- **email:** A Contact’s email address in SendGrid

#### Optional Properties

In addition to the required email field, companies can add many Reserved or Custom Fields to sync with Grouparoo Properties. These can be accessed from the Send Record Property dropdown menu.

### Group Data

In addition to mapping Grouparoo Properties to SendGrid Contact Fields, you can use Grouparoo Groups to create SendGrid Lists.

In SendGrid, Lists help companies segment their audience to improve the delivery of custom messaging.
