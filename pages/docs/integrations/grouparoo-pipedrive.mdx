## Pipedrive Export Contacts

This Destination enables you to sync your Grouparoo Records as Person contacts in Pipedrive.

Companies use Grouparoo to keep their Pipedrive Person Contacts up-to-date in order to communicate with customers and manage their marketing strategy.

To [create a Destination](/docs/config/destinations), you make choices about what data to sync.

### Sync Modes

- **Sync**: Add, update, and remove Pipedrive Person Contacts as needed.This option looks for new records, changes to existing records, and deletions.
- **Additive**: Add and update Pipedrive Person Contacts as needed, but do not remove anybody. This option looks for new Person Contacts to add to Pipedrive and changes to existing Pipedrive Person Contacts, but does not keep track of deletions.
- **Enrich**: Only update those Person Contacts that already exist in Pipedrive. Do not add or remove Person Contacts. This option will only update existing Person Contacts in Pipedrive.

### Destination Options

Some types of Destinations require further clarification about how data should sync. In the case of Pipedrive, there are no further Options to configure before moving on to mapping Record Data.

### Record Data

Mapping Record Properties to Pipedrive Fields is the key to syncing data to Pipedrive Person Contacts.

Pipedrive’s Fields can be used to tailor data management for a business’ marketing needs.

<br></br>
<br></br>

#### Required Properties

It is required to map Grouparoo Properties to the **Name** and **Email** Pipedrive Fields. Choose the Grouparoo Property that corresponds to each of these Fields from the dropdown menu.

- **Name: **A Person Contact’s full name in Pipedrive
- **Email:** A Person Contact’s email address in Pipedrive

#### Optional Properties

In addition to the required fields, Pipedrive allows Admin Users to create Custom Fields. Custom Fields must be set up from within the Pipedrive account, using an Admin User profile.

### Group Data

In addition to mapping Grouparoo Properties to Pipedrive Fields, you can use Grouparoo Groups to apply Pipedrive Filters.

In Pipedrive, Filters help marketing teams create reports on deals, people and organizations represented by your Pipedrive data.
