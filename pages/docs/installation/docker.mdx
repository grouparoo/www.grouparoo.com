Grouparoo is easy to deploy with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). An example project can be found at https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example-docker, and further information can be found in the [Docker deploy section](/docs/deployment/docker).

### Step 1: Create a new git repository and Grouparoo Project

Create a new git repository on your local machine. Note the following:

- Do not include an environment file, `.env`. Your environment variables will be managed by Docker
- Include a `package.json` file which contains your dependencies
  - You can generate one with the [`grouparoo init` command](/docs/cli/setup)
- Include a `.dockerignore` file which excludes `node_modules` and any local config you might have (ie: `.env`)

### Step 2: Build your Dockerfile

Include a `Dockerfile` which is similar the to the below. We are building a single `Dockerfile` which can be used in multiple modes. For example, the image can be run as a background task worker (`WEB_SERVER=false`, `WORKERS=10`) or web server (`WEB_SERVER=true`, `WORKERS=0`). These settings are controlled by environment variables. The default environment variables set here are expected to be overridden by your runtime environment (Swarm, Kubernetes, etc).

```bash
# Dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /grouparoo

ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=3000
ENV WEB_URL=https://grouparoo.company.com:$PORT
ENV WEB_SERVER="true"
ENV SERVER_TOKEN="change-me"
ENV WORKERS=1
ENV REDIS_URL="redis://redis:6379/0"
ENV DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/grouparoo_docker"
ENV S3_ACCESS_KEY=""
ENV S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
ENV S3_REGION=""
ENV S3_BUCKET=""

COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run prepare
RUN npm prune

WORKDIR /grouparoo/node_modules/@grouparoo/core
CMD ["./bin/start"]

EXPOSE $PORT/tcp
```

### Step 3: Build your docker image

Run:

```bash
docker build .
```

### Step 4: Run Your Image

Push and run your docker image!
