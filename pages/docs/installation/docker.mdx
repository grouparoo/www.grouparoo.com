Grouparoo is easy to deploy with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). An example project can be found at https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example, and futher information can be found in the [Docker deploy section](/docs/deployment/docker).

### Step 1: Create a new git repository

Create a new git repository on your local machine. Note the following:

- Do not include an environment file, `.env`. Your environment variables will be managed by Docker
- Include a `package.json` file which contains your dependencies and commands per the [deployment Guide](/docs/deployment)
- Include a `.dockerignore` file which excludes `node_modules` and any local config you might have (ie: `.env`)
- Include a `Dockerfile` which is similar the to the below. We are building a `Dockerfile` which can be used in multiple modes, as a background task worker or web server, which are controlled by Environment Variables.

```bash
# Dockerfile
FROM node:12

WORKDIR /grouparoo

ENV NODE_ENV='production'
ENV PORT=3000
ENV WEB_URL=http://localhost:$PORT
ENV WEB_SERVER=true
ENV SERVER_TOKEN="change-me"
ENV SCHEDULER=true
ENV WORKERS=1
ENV REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
ENV DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/grouparoo_development"
ENV S3_ACCESS_KEY=""
ENV S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
ENV S3_REGION=""
ENV S3_BUCKET=""

COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run prepare
RUN npm prune

WORKDIR /grouparoo/node_modules/@grouparoo/core
CMD ["./api/bin/start"]

EXPOSE $PORT/tcp
```

### Step 2: Build your docker image

Run:

```bash
docker build .
```

### Step 3: Run Your Image

Push and run your docker image!
