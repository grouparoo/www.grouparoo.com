This guide will help you run the Grouparoo application on your local machine using Node.js.

## Step 1: Install Runtime and Databases

Grouparoo is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application and requires Node.js version 12 or higher. You can download Node.js from their [website](https://nodejs.org/) or through the package manager for your operating system.

By default, running Grouparoo locally relies on the following dependencies:

- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

However, if you want to skip these dependencies when getting started, there is an option to use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and a Redis mock. More on this below.

If you want to use Redis and Postgres, let's get them installed.

**On OSX**:

```bash
# Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh) if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

brew install node # Install Node.JS

brew install redis # Install Redis
brew services start redis # Start Redis

brew install postgresql # Install Postgres
brew services start postgresql # Start Postgres
```

**On Linux/Ubuntu**:

```bash
# Install NVM
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
nvm install v12 # install v12 of node.js
nvm use v12 # use v12 of node.js

sudo apt install redis-server # Install Redis

sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib # Install Postgres
```

### Create Grouparoo Database

Using either Postgres or SQLite, create a database for Grouparoo to use. This is where the application data will be stored, such as profiles, apps, and sources. In our example, we've called the database `grouparoo_development`. This is what it looks like for Postgres:

```bash
createdb grouparoo_development # Create a database for Grouparoo
```

## Step 2: Generate `package.json` and `.env`

In a new directory, run the following command to generate the files Grouparoo needs:

```bash
npx grouparoo generate
```

This will create a `package.json` and `.env` files like these:

**`package.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "my-grouparoo-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@grouparoo/core": "latest",
    "@grouparoo/mysql": "latest",
    "@grouparoo/postgres": "latest",
    "@grouparoo/mailchimp": "latest",
    "@grouparoo/csv": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && npm run prepare",
    "start": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && ./api/bin/start",
    "dev": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && ./api/bin/dev"
  },
  "grouparoo": {
    "plugins": [
      "@grouparoo/mysql",
      "@grouparoo/postgres",
      "@grouparoo/mailchimp",
      "@grouparoo/csv"
    ]
  }
}
```

There are some environment variables needed by Grouparoo that need to be set by your host/docker image. These variables tell Grouparoo how to connect to your database, which URL to use, etc. In development, we can also load these variables from a `.env` file that lives alongside your `package.json`. At minimum, you will need to set the following variables:

**`.env`**

```bash
PORT=3000
WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000
WEB_SERVER=true
SCHEDULER=true
WORKERS=1
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
# Or REDIS_URL="redis://mock" to use an in-memory redis.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/grouparoo_development"
# Or DATABASE_URL="sqlite://grouparoo_development.sqlite" for SQLite.
SERVER_TOKEN="a-random-string"
```

To use an in-memory redis (Redis mock) and/or SQLite, set the `REDIS_URL` and `DATABASE_URL` appropriately:

```bash
REDIS_URL="redis://mock"
DATABASE_URL="sqlite://grouparoo_development.sqlite"
```

> Grouparoo is primarily configured via Environment variables.
> Learn more about [the environment variables in use by Grouparoo](/docs/config/environment).

`npm install` will not succeed without these environment variables being set.

Only these 2 files are needed to make an "app" for Grouparoo to run. There is an example in the [app-example](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example/blob/master/package.json) directory.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. This will also run `npm prepare` which will compile the typescript application and build the web components. `npx grouparoo generate` will do this automatically for you.

### Step 4: Configure & Run!

Now you're ready to run the application. You can test to make sure running `npm start` starts the server. You should then be able to visit `http://localhost:3000`. _Note that starting the Grouparoo application will also migrate your database and generally configure things as-needed._

If everything looks good, it's time to get your application configured. Head over to the [Configuration Guides](/docs/config).
