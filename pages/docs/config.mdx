After you've installed Grouparoo locally, you're ready to configure it! The easiest way to configure Grouparoo is through Code Config. Get started with Code Config below or reference one of our Configuration Guides.

## Code Config

To use Grouparoo to import and export your data, you will be configuring our main objects: Apps, Sources, Destinations, Properties, etc. You can [learn more about Grouparoo's product concepts here](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts). You will be using the Grouparoo CLI's `generate`, `validate`, and `apply` commands to ensure that the application can read from your Sources and write to your Destinations.

Configuration files are either JSON or Javscript which allow you the flexibility to manipulate data or load configuration from external sources:

```js
// file: config/apps/data_warehouse.js

exports.default = async function GetDataWarehouseConfig() {
  const { databasePassword } = await fetch(`/api/company/secrets`);

  return [
    {
      name: "Data Warehouse",
      class: "app",
      id: "data_warehouse",
      type: "postgres",
      options: {
        host: "127.0.0.1",
        port: "5432",
        username: "person",
        password: databasePassword,
        database: "data_warehouse",
      },
    },
  ];
};
```

You can learn more about the [configuration files here](/docs/deployment/code-config).
