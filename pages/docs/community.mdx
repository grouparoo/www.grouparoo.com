First, **Thank You**!

Grouparoo relies on the contributions of [many people](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/graphs/contributors) just like you to create the best marketing infrastructure & automation tools.

Thank you for taking the time to join this open source community, and create something we can all use!

## Chat

The best place to quickly interact with other users and Grouparoo developers is on Slack.<br/>[Click here to get access.](/chat)

## Forum

Ask development and usage questions for everyone on our [Github Discussions Forum](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/discussions).

## Code of Conduct

By contributing to Grouparoo and its related projects, you agree to abide by the [Grouparoo Code of Conduct](/docs/community/code-of-conduct). Please read this document. We as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Roadmap

You can view the [Grouparoo Roadmap on Github](/roadmap).

</a>

This roadmap exists so we can share the work we are planning and currently working on with the Community. Not every [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/terminology/#story) we are working on will be reflected here, but the high-level [features and epics](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/terminology/#epic) will be listed.

We welcome your thoughts and ideas on our upcoming features, so please feel free to comment on the linked Issues or Conversations.

## Support

We strive to handle bugs and problems in the open. This means that we've adopted a support process which allows us to discuss the problem publicly and archive that conversation for the future. In this way, we can build a body of of questions and answers that future Grouparoo users can find to help themselves, leading to a stronger, informed community.

Learn more about the Grouparoo support process [here](/support).

Note that the majority of the time, Issues opened will not be large enough to make it onto the [Roadmap](/roadmap). However, we will link issues that are prioritized to the story in our internal task tracker, and share the status of that work on the Github Issue.

## Contributions

All changes to Grouparoo should be contributed via [Pull Requests](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/pulls) to our Github Project. Changes by any other method will be rejected. GitHub allows us to coordinate and communicate in a single place. Pull requests also allow us to run our test suite against all new code to ensure that things still work the way they are supposed to after your change.

### Getting Started

Before you start, please create a new [Discussion Topic](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/discussions/new) to discuss your plans for the new feature with us. Use the `ideas` category. We want to be sure that you won't be duplicating work, and that we will be able to merge in your work. Failing that, members of Grouparoo Inc will endeavor to quickly comment on an open Issue or Pull Request regarding it's mergeability.

At this time, Grouparoo Inc. is focused on expanding and enhancing our core
features, in addition to developing our paid plugins. With that in mind, there
are some areas of the codebase that may not be stable enough to accept Pull
Requests, or areas of the product that are undergoing significant changes.
There are also categories of work which fall outside the scope of of the core
product which should be moved to a plugin. Similarly, Pull Requests that
drastically change the functionality of an existing section of the product are
unlikely to be merged, as they likely conflict with our roadmap.

The best place to contribute to Grouparoo is by adding a new connection to add
a new `Source` or `Destination` via a [plugin](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/tree/master/plugins/%40grouparoo).

### Ownership

By contributing to Grouparoo, you agree that you have granted ownership of the
work to Grouparoo Inc, to be maintained and distributed in accordance with our [open-source License (Mozilla 2.0)](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

### Testing

Grouparoo is a large project with lots of different plugins and tools. We
don't expect you to know about everything, so that's why we have a robust test
suite. This allows us to ensure that no matter who makes a change, Grouparoo
will continue to work the way it is supposed to.

With that in mind, all new features to Grouparoo must also include additions
to the test suite to ensure that in the future, we can maintain your work.
When writing tests, write the smallest test that ensures that your work is
tested. _Every contribution to the codebase should have an associated test._

Be sure that your changes pass the test suite! Run `npm test` to run the full
test suite. You will need <code>redis</code>, <code>postgres</code>, <code>chromedriver</code> along with <code>node.js</code> installed. You can
find instructions on [getting started as a developer here](/docs/development).

### Linting

We use [prettier.js](https://prettier.io/) to manage our code style and lint rules. We run prettier as part of our
test suite, and your contributions must pass. Prettier is very opinionated and
inflexible such that we cannot inject our own opinions. There are no
eslint/jshint files to manage in this project.

### Comments

If your contribution adds a new feature of modifies an existing behavior,
document your changes using [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org). We use Typedoc to automatically document Grouparoo. There are many plugins
to help you with this, and are built into editors like VSCode.
