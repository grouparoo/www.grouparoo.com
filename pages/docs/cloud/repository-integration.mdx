Grouparoo Cloud requires three things to function: A github action `.yaml` file and two secrets to identify and authorize the code config repository.

It is assumed you have an existing repository on github that was setup using our [Config UI](/docs/config).

### GitHub Repository Secrets

Grouparoo Cloud requires two secrets to be available in your repository: `GROUPAROO_CLOUD_TOKEN` and `GROUPAROO_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`.

If these values have not already been provided for you, you can get them from [Grouparoo Cloud](https://cloud.grouparoo.com/) in your Project's Integrations page.

In your GitHub repository go to: Settings -> Secrets -> New repository secret.

Add `GROUPAROO_CLOUD_TOKEN` and `GROUPAROO_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` with the provided values.

<sub>
  The Project ID should look similar to <code>prj_some-set-of-values</code>.
</sub>

### GitHub Action

We recommend creating a new branch for this since our system can check PR builds for validity, saving you some potential headache.

Create a file in your repository: `.github/workflows/grouparoo-cloud.yml`
And place the below code into it.

```yml
name: grouparoo-cloud

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  ci:
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      - uses: grouparoo/cloud-action@v2
        with:
          project_id: ${{ secrets.GROUPAROO_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GROUPAROO_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
  deploy:
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      - uses: grouparoo/cloud-action@v2
        with:
          type: deploy
          project_id: ${{ secrets.GROUPAROO_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GROUPAROO_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

Then create a pull request against your main branch. It may take a few minutes but our CI system will kick in and confirm that your Code Config is valid and host-able. If CI runs green, merge and our system will deploy it into Grouparoo Cloud. Once it's available your Project page in Grouparoo Cloud will provide a link!
