There are a number of ways to run Grouparoo to fit your workflow. We believe that the 3 phases to a successfully Grouparoo Deployment are:

1. Project Maintenance
2. Configuration
3. Development, Testing, and Deployment

### Project Maintenance

Configuring your Grouparoo Project starts by making a new `git` repository in a new directory. You then can use the `grouparoo` cli tool to initialize a new project.

Grouparoo is a node.js project at heart, so you will be configuring your environment, creating a `package.json` and installing dependencies. You can also use commands like `npm install` to replace the Grouparoo commands in this section.

### Configuration

To use Grouparoo to import and export your data, you will be configuring our main objects: Apps, Sources, Destinations, Properties, etc. You can [learn more about Grouparoo's product concepts here](http://localhost:3001/docs/getting-started/product-concepts). You will be using the Grouparoo CLI's `generate`, `validate`. and `apply` commands to ensure that the application can read from your Sources and write to your Destinations.

Configuration files are either JSON or Javscript which allow you the flexibility to manipulate data or load configuration from external sources:

```js
// file: config/apps/data_warehouse.js

exports.default = async function GetDataWarehouseConfig() {
  const { databasePassword } = await fetch(`/api/company/secrets`);

  return [
    {
      name: "Data Warehouse",
      class: "app",
      id: "data_warehouse",
      type: "postgres",
      options: {
        host: "127.0.0.1",
        port: "5432",
        username: "person",
        password: databasePassword,
        database: "data_warehouse",
      },
    },
  ];
};
```

You can learn more about the [configuration files here](/docs/deployment/code-config).

### Development, Testing, and Deployment

After your Grouparoo application is configured, we expect that you'll want to trial your configuration locally before deploying to production.

Unlike other tools, Grouparoo fits into your developer workflow allowing you to run the same code within multiple environments (dev/staging/prod) and we provide tools which allow you to craft meaningful tests around your data orchestration process.

Commands like `grouparoo sync` allow you to trial the whole sync process with only one profile to check for expected results. In combination with commands like `grouparoo run`, you may also want to start fresh with a new database (`grouparoo destroy`) or write test to ensure your sync process is working as you expect. You can write [tests for your Grouparoo data using Jest](/docs/running-grouparoo/testing).

Finally, you can choose to run the Grouparoo application in a one-off mode (`grouparoo run`) or as a persistent server (`grouparoo start` / `npm start`) - whichever best fits your use-case.
