## Try Grouparoo Now!

The quickest way to see Grouparoo in action is try it locally with Node.js.

Assuming you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12+) installed, all you have to do to get started is:

```shell
# in a new directory
npm install -g grouparoo
grouparoo init .
grouparoo config
```

You can also try the [`grouparoo/omnibus` docker image](https://github.com/grouparoo/omnibus). This Docker image contains a number of popular Grouparoo plugins, including commercially licensed `@grouparoo/ui-enterprise` package. You can trial this docker image for a 1-month period before [contacting us for a license](/meet).

```shell
curl -L https://www.grouparoo.com/docker-compose --output docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
# wait for boot
# visit http://localhost:3000
```
