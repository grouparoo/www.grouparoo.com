First, ðŸŽ‰THANK YOUðŸŽ‰.

Grouparoo relies on the contributions of many people just like you to create the best marketing infrastructure & automation tools. Thank you for taking the time to join this open source community, and create something we can all use! By contributing to Grouparoo, you agree to our [Community Guidelines](/docs/community) and [Code of Conduct](/docs/community/code-of-conduct)

## Getting Started

When developing Grouparoo, you'll be running code within the [`grouparoo monorepo`](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo). This git repository contains a number of related bu separate projects. There are `Apps`, `CLI`, `Core`, `Plugins`, along with a number of tools and utilities. We use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.js.org) to install packages to allow us to run and test all of these packages together without needing to publish them to NPM. We use [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to publish packages.

- **Apps**: These are example applications like a Grouparoo customer would run - they require `@grouparoo/core` and any number of plugins and may have toggled certain settings
- **Core**: The `@grouparoo/core` project is the main part of any Grouparoo application and includes the API (both web and workers).
- **CLI**: The Grouparoo CLI tool, ie: `grouparoo init .`
- **Plugins**: There are opt-in add-ons for Grouparoo customers, and contain the logic to connect to new sources & destinations, or otherwise add new functionality to Grouparoo.
- **UI**: The grouparoo UI plugins, `ui-community` and `ui-enterprise` and shared component libraries.

### Running the Monorepo

## Typescript

Grouparoo is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which means that we need to compile our Typescript to Javascript before we can run it. This is true for Grouparoo plugins, but not necessarily true for Grouparoo Apps or Core, if you are using `npm run dev` (development mode), which will handle the compilation on the fly. Every sub-project in the Grouparoo Monorepo has an `npm run prepare` command which handles the compilation process. `npm run prepare` is also an [NPM lifecycle hook](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#prepublish-and-prepare), which will automatically run after every `npm install` as well.

If you are developing a plugin, you will need to `npm run prepare` it before seeing your changes. In many cases, the `prepare` step only calls out to `tsc`, and in these cases, you may be able to `tsc --watch` to automatically source changes and rebuild your plugin.

Grouparoo self-documents its Typescript interface to [docs.grouparoo.com](https://docs.grouparoo.com) via [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/). The docs from the `main` branch are automatically published to this site. If you want to read the docs for an older version of Grouparoo or a different branch, you can generate the docs locally by running `cd core && npm run docs` in this repository.

## Architecture

Learn about the Grouparoo architecture and models from the other pages in this documentation section.

## Dependencies

Grouparoo is built on top of many wonderful open source technologies. An exhaustive list of our dependencies can be found within our [package.json](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/main/core/package.json) files. This below list provides links to the core packages we rely on.

Grouparoo Core:

- General
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org)
  - [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)
  - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- API
  - [Actionhero](https://www.actionherojs.com/)
  - [Sequelzie-Typescript](https://github.com/RobinBuschmann/sequelize-typescript)
  - [Sequelzie](https://sequelize.org/)
  - [Node Resque](https://github.com/actionhero/node-resque)
- Web
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
  - [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

All dependencies Grouparoo uses must be licensed under a non-viral open-source licence that allows for commercial use. We audit every dependency in every sub-project of this monorepo via [license-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker). The list of licenses we accept can be found [here](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/main/tools/license-checker/check).

## Populating Demo Data

The `@grouparoo/demo` plugin makes it easy to generate sample data! You can use the `staging-community` app to try things out:

```bash
cd apps/staging-community
# populate the system with 1000 profiles, properties, 1000 purchases, and some groups
grouparoo demo purchases

# including the --scale param allows you to control how many profiles you make. e.g. --scale 10 makes 10,000 extra profiles.
grouparoo demo purchases --scale 10
```

**Note: These commands will clear all existing data in your Grouparoo database, replacing it with the sample data.**

You can then use the following credentials to log in:

- Username: `demo@grouparoo.com`
- Password: `password`

## Testing

Grouparoo uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as our testing framework. To run tests, first make sure you've installed all dependencies in the root of the project.

```bash
pnpm install # we use pnpm to manage the monorepo
```

You will need `chromedriver` installed to run the automated browser tests as well:

- OSX: `brew cask install chromedriver`
- Windows: TODO
- Linux: TODO

Next, create the test databases:

```bash
cd core
./bin/create_test_databases
```

Running `npm test` from the top-level of this monorepo will run the `npm test` command in every sub-package of the monorepo via pnpm. You can also test an individual package by entering that directory and running `npm test`. If you want to run a single test file you can `./node_modules/.bin/jest /path/to/test` and you can watch files with jest's `--watch` flag.

Jest will automatically test the latest version of your typescript files, and you do not need to compile your code to test. However, the test suite should test the compile step as well. We usually run `npm run prepare` as a `pretest` NPM hook.

A note on chromedriver for OSX Users: As Chrome updates, you may need to `brew cask reinstall chromedriver` to keep up to date as well. Every time you update chromedriver, you will need to re-authorize the application to run in system preferences, as it is unsigned.

### `@grouparoo/spec-helper`

The plugin `@grouparoo/spec-helper` exists to make testing easier, especially within plugins. It contains factories, startup/shutdown helpers for the application, and reasonable testing defaults. Unlike a traditional node module, including this package into a test suite **will** have side-effects - specifically your working directly will be changed into `@grouparoo/core` so you can run the application like normal in your tests. You can see what happens [here](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/78f0dae336b641f653422db3c1c5f1a5488f3d8f/plugins/%40grouparoo/spec-helper/src/lib/specHelper.ts#L7-L21).

```js
import path from "path";
// First, set an environment variable so that @grouparoo/core will load this plugin if you are doing an integration test
process.env.GROUPAROO_INJECTED_PLUGINS = JSON.stringify({
  "@grouparoo/hubspot": { path: path.join(__dirname, "..", "..") },
});

// Then, include the spec helper
import { helper } from "@grouparoo/spec-helper";
// Note! Because of tree-shaking, if you don't actually *use* what you've imported form @grouparoo/spec-helper in your test file, the import statement will be ignored.  In that case, do a raw import of the file:
// import "@grouparoo/spec-helper";

// import other things, including @grouparoo/core if you need it
import { Profile } from "@grouparoo/core";

describe("my plugin", () => {
  // This command injects a `beforeAll` and `afterAll` to startup and shutdown the server.  There are lots of options to help you with testing.  If you need access to Models, you need to turn on the server so it can connect to Postgres
  helper.grouparooTestServer({ truncate: true, enableTestPlugin: true });

  // Now the server will be booted up, connected to the database, and you can use factories and models like normal
  test("works", async () => {
    const factory = await helper.factories.profile();
    const profile = await Profile.findOne({ where: { id: factory.id } });
    expect(profile.id).toBe(profile.id);
  });
});
```

## Notes on Example Apps

- If you create a new example app, you will need to `pnpm install` again to link up the dependencies in the monorepo.
- Be sure that your `pacakge.json`'s `name` field matches the folder name.
- Be sure that `package.json`'s `grouparoo.grouparoo_monorepo_app` matches the folder name.

## Deploying the Example Server

On the server:

1. Ensure you have the proper environment variables set
2. Run `pnpm install` at the root of this project, which will run the build steps too
3. Run `cd apps/staging-public && npm run start`

See the [`Procfile`](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/main/Procfile) for an example of how to run a web and worker process independently.
If you are deploying to Heroku or a similar PaaS, they might prune node_modules that aren't explicitly in "dependencies". However, due to the way lerna works, this might delete all of your modules. Check with your provider for how to disable this (ex: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#build-behavior)
