Grouparoo's [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) Plugin enables you to export contacts and groups to Salesforce.

This guide will show you how to work with the Salesforce Plugin to [create a Destination](#create-an-salesforce-destination) to export your data.

## Create a Salesforce Destination

Once your App exists, you can generate a Salesforce Destination using the `generate` command. You must specify a `parent`, which should match the `id` of the App you just created.

This is the simplest form of [Generator](/docs/getting-started/product-concepts#generator) for Destinations:

```
$ grouparoo generate salesforce:destination salesforce_destination --parent my_salesforce_app
```

This would generate a config file at `config/destinations/salesforce_destination.js` in your Grouparoo project. You can then edit this file to match your desired configuration. Here is an example of what this config object will look like after generation:

```js
// config/destinations/salesforce_destination.js

exports.default = async function buildConfig() {
  return [
    {
      id: "salesforce_destination",
      name: "salesforce_destination",
      class: "destination",
      type: "salesforce-export",
      appId: "my_salesforce_app",
      groupId: "...",
      syncMode: "...",

      options: {
        recordObject: "Contact",
        recordMatchField: "Email",
        groupObject: "Campaign",
        groupNameField: "Name",
        membershipObject: "CampaignMember",
        membershipRecordField: "ContactId",
        membershipGroupField: "CampaignId",
        recordReferenceField: "AccountId",
        recordReferenceObject: "Account",
        recordReferenceMatchField: "Name",
      },

      mapping: {
        Email: "email",
        FirstName: "firstName",
        LastName: "lastName",
      },

      destinationGroupMemberships: {
        "High Value Customers": "highValueCustomers",
      },
    },
  ];
};
```

For more information on what all these properties mean and how to configure them, see [Configuring your Destination](/docs/config/code-config/destinations#configuring-your-destination).

### Sync Modes

The Salesforce Destination supports all three sync modes:

- **Sync** (`sync`): Add, update, and remove records as needed.
- **Additive** (`additive`): Add and update records as needed, but do not remove anybody.
- **Enrich** (`enrich`): Only update records that already exist in the Destination. Do not add or remove anybody.

You can set the desired sync mode through the `syncMode` property in the config file:

```js
syncMode: "additive";
```

### Destination Options

Here are the available options for a Salesforce Destination:

<OptionsList
  options={{
    recordObject: {
      displayName: "recordObject",
      description: "Which object in Salesforce represents a Grouparoo record?",
    },
    recordMatchField: {
      displayName: "recordMatchField",
      description:
        "Which field in the record Object is used to match Grouparoo records?",
    },
    groupObject: {
      displayName: "groupObject",
      description: "Which object in Salesforce represents a Grouparoo Group?",
    },
    groupNameField: {
      displayName: "groupNameField",
      description:
        "Which field in the Group Object is used for the name of a Grouparoo Group?",
    },
    membershipObject: {
      displayName: "membershipObject",
      description:
        "Which object in Salesforce maps the record object to the Group object?",
    },
    membershipRecordField: {
      displayName: "membershipRecordField",
      description:
        "Which object in Salesforce maps the record object to the Group object?",
    },
    membershipGroupField: {
      displayName: "membershipGroupField",
      description:
        "Which field in the membership Object is the reference to the Group?",
    },
    recordReferenceField: {
      displayName: "recordReferenceField",
      description:
        "Is there a reference field on the record Object to fill out?",
    },
    recordReferenceObject: {
      displayName: "recordReferenceObject",
      description:
        "If there is a reference field, which Object should be created to apply to the record?",
    },
    recordReferenceMatchField: {
      displayName: "recordReferenceMatchField",
      description:
        "If there is a reference field, how should it be matched to Grouparoo records?",
    },
  }}
/>

You can configure these options by setting them inside the `options` object of the config file:

```js
options: {
  recordObject: "Contact",
  recordMatchField: "Email",
  groupObject: "Campaign",
  groupNameField: "Name",
  membershipObject: "CampaignMember",
  membershipRecordField: "ContactId",
  membershipGroupField: "CampaignId",
  recordReferenceField: "AccountId",
  recordReferenceObject: "Account",
  recordReferenceMatchField: "Name",
},
```

### Property Mappings

These mappings are what tell Grouparoo which Properties you want to sync to the Destination and what they should be called. For this Plugin, **Grouparoo Properties** can be mapped to a **Salesforce Object** specified on the `options` object.

You can also map to custom attributes that you've defined on Salesforce by adding them directly to the Mapping object (also include the \_\_c suffix).

Here's an example of how this would look in the config file. Note that the keys refer to Salesforce Attribute names and values refer to Grouparoo Property IDs.

```js
mapping: {
  Email: "email",
  FistName: "firstName",
  "custom_lifetime_value__c": "ltv",
},
```

### Group Mappings

You can use **Group Memberships** to automatically add your contacts to **Salesforce Objects**, defined by the property `groupObject` on the `options` object.

Here's an example of how to configure this in the config file. Keys refer to the name of the tag to be shown on Salesforce and values refer to the Grouparoo Group ID.

```js
destinationGroupMemberships: {
  "High Value Customers": "highValueCustomers",
},
```

## Salesforce Next Steps

Once you have the Plugin installed, App created, and a Source or Destination configured, you are ready to [validate](/docs/cli/config#validate), [apply](/docs/cli/config#apply), then [import or export your data](/docs/cli/run#run)!
