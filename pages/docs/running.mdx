Okay. So you have Grouparoo installed locally. And you've configured it with your Apps, Sources, Destinations, and other objects. Now it's time to see it all work before going to production.

Unlike other tools, Grouparoo fits into your developer workflow allowing you to run the same code within multiple environments (dev/staging/prod) and we provide tools which allow you to craft meaningful tests around your data orchestration process.

Commands like `grouparoo sync` allow you to trial the whole sync process with only one Record to check for expected results. In combination with commands like `grouparoo run`, you may also want to start fresh with a new database (`grouparoo reset data`) or write test to ensure your sync process is working as you expect. You can write [tests for your Grouparoo data using Jest](/docs/running/testing).

Finally, you can choose to run the Grouparoo application in a one-off mode (`grouparoo run`) or as a persistent server (`grouparoo start` / `npm start`) - whichever best fits your use-case. You can also learn more about the [Grouparoo CLI](/docs/cli) or [integrating Grouparoo into your ELT/ELT process](/docs/running/orchestration).
