Grouparoo can be extended with Plugins to add more Apps, Sources, and Destinations.

## Installing a Plugin

The Grouparoo command line tool is used to add a Plugin to your project via `grouparoo install [package]`. You can learn more about the `grouparoo install` command [here](/docs/cli/setup). So, if you wanted to install the `@grouparoo/mysql` Plugin, you would run:

```bash
grouparoo install @grouparoo/mysql # install the latest version
```

That's it!

Please ensure that the versions of your plugins match the version of `@grouparoo/core` that you are using **exactly** in your `package.json` file. If you need to install a specific version of a Plugin to match `@grouparoo/core`, you can:

```bash
grouparoo install @grouparoo/mysql@v1.2.3 # install v1.2.3 specifically
```

## Available Community Plugins

## Paid Plugins

While many Grouparoo plugins are available for free via an open-source license, some require a commercial license.

### Obtaining Paid Plugins

To install a paid Plugin, you will need to authenticate to the npm registry to download and install the new package. Grouparoo will provide you with a "npm access token" which will grant you access to the paid Grouparoo plugins you have purchased for your organization. For every computer that needs access to those plugins (developer machine, CI, build server, etc) you will need to provide that token to npm in one of the following ways:

Create a new `.npmrc` file in your Grouparoo project. This can be checked into your project and Docker images if kept private. The contents of the file will look like:

```bash
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=NPM_TOKEN
# ie: //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=abc123
```

You can learn more about using npm access tokens and other ways of storing them from the [npm website](https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow).

### UI Editions

The Grouparoo User Interface (UI) is offered in two separate editions: `@grouparoo/ui-community` and `@grouparoo/ui-enterprise`.

The open-source `@grouparoo/ui-community` edition contains everything an engineering team needs to successfully deploy and monitor Grouparoo to sync data. It includes the following features:

- Monitor the application.
- View objects like Properties, Records, Groups, etc.
- Trigger runs.

The closed-source `@grouparoo/ui-enterprise` edition is everything a company needs to successfully empower all their teams with the data they need. It offers everything in `@grouparoo/ui-community`, in addition to:

- Allow non-technical users to configure the Grouparoo server via the web.
- Provide a no-code way to create & manage Properties, Apps, Sources, Schedules, Destinations, Groups, etc.
- Manage permissions and access for users across the organization, including Enterprise login, Team management, etc.
- Do analysis of your data and gain insights.

Note: Please ensure that you are only have one version of the `@grouparoo/ui-*` plugins installed, not both.

## Creating your own Plugins

Being an open-source project, Grouparoo makes it easy to create your own plugins as well! You can learn more from the [Plugin development docs](/docs/development/plugins).
