This document is a collection of the guidelines Grouparoo uses when dealing with Models and Databases internally.

## Grouparoo Migration Guidelines

- No sequential IDs. We use app-generated unique IDs for primary keys (UUIDs) because we are working with large datasets and databases sometimes can't count (I'm looking at you, Redshift!).
- Every table gets `id`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt`, even if it seems silly now... we will need it eventually!
- No `enums` in the database, use `VARCHAR(191)`. Migrating an enum is too hard and database-specific. Of course, we can use ENUMs in the Models.
- No default values for strings. Instead, Define defaults in the model. If you want to add a default value to a non-null column, you can accomplish this with a 2-part migration: first add the column with a default value (to update all the existing rows), and then remove the default.
- Do not re-specify default values. For example, setting a default value of null on a nullable string column is redundant.
- No foreign key constraints in the database... do these checks in the model. But, it's probably a good idea to add a search index to these
- All guids/uuids are 40 characters long - a real V4 UUID (36 characters) + 3 letter prefix + underscore, ie: `app_168c4564-e389-4fbd-8338-db04d62022ba`
- Do not use compound indexes for SQLite. There's a [Seqeuelize bug](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/12823)
  - Instead, do the uniqueness validation in the model in a `@BeforeSave` hook
  - You can continue to add compound indexes for Postgres (do so with a check against `config.seqeulize.dialect === 'postgres'`)
- All migrations should be within a transation. If part of the migration fails, the whole migration will be rolled back.

## Grouparoo Model Guidelines

- No private methods. This breaks compatibility between Typescript-exported model definitions (to JS) and the TS files themselves. We require this compatibility as plugins both source and export to core... so a single runtime's require path may be `core/dist -> plugin/src` or even `core/dist -> plugin/dist -> core/src`
  - Instead, Pretend it's 1999 and prefix methods you want to be private with `_`, i.e. `async _privateMethod()`
- Do not re-specify default values. For example, setting a default value of null on a nullable string column is redundant (eg: `@Default(null)`).
- New models need to be enumerated a few places:
  - `Index.ts`
  - `SpecHelper.ts`
  - `modules/plugin.ts`
- In order to keep models _smaller_, we make the distinction between the Model itself and ModelOps
  - Table/Column definitions, Class methods, Setters, Getters, and Validations belong on the Model
  - Methods that mutate the Model (or more than one Model), or interact with a Plugin, belong in a ModelOp
  - It is appropriate for convenience to have a Model method call out to a ModelOp (ie: `Record.import` => `RecordOpt.import(record)`)

## Querying

- As we are working with larger volumes of data, we cannot assume that our querying in batches (via `limit` & `offset`) won't change out from under us. To that end, using `offset` is a code smell. We should instead be ordering by some non-changing column (`id`, `createdAt`, etc) and storing the highest value as a `highWaterMark` for the next subsequent query.

```sql
-- bad, what if updated_at changed for some of the users as we query?
select * from users order by updated_at asc limit 100 offset 100

-- good
select * from users order by uuid asc limit 100;
-- next time
select * from users where uuid >= previousValue order by uuid asc limit 100;
```

- Do not order by `rand()` or `random()`. It's very slow on large datasets. There are other [alternatives](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/pull/716) possible, but may require more than one query.

## Avoid Circular Dependencies

- If you are loading a model in an initializer in the `@grouparoo/core` project, you need to load it from the file's direct export, not `@grouparoo/core`'s main export. ie: `import {App} from '../models/App'` not `import {App} from '../App'`.
