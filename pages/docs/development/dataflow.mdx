The Grouparoo Application's main job is to collect data from `Sources`, store that data to build a robust `Profiles`, build `Groups` of `Profiles`, and finally syndicate this data with `Destination`s, your other marketing tools.

This document is place to centrally describe how all of this works!

## Core Data Models

### Profiles and Profile Properties

The main object in Grouparoo is a `Profile`. A profile by itself is simply an `id` and the time it was created and last updated. It is a "join table" to collect many `Profile Properties`, which act as a key-value store for the data about `Profiles`. For example, a common `Profile Property` would be `key='email', value='evan@grouparoo.com', type='string'`. We also store when each `Profile Property` was created and updated.

### Groups

`Groups` are a collection of `Profiles`.

There are 2 types of `Groups`: "Manual" and "Calculated".

- Manual `Groups` contain profiles that a Grouparoo user has added to the group. The membership of Manual `Group`s does not change.
- Calculated `Groups` are constantly recalculated against `Profile Properties`. These dynamic lists of `Profiles` are how you build up cohorts that change over time. You may have a group of `Abandoned Carts Last Week` that checks a `Profile Property` of "last_abandoned_card_date" and makes sure it was within the last 7 days. You might also choose to segment your customers by the language they speak with a "Locale" `Profile Property`.

Profiles can be in many groups at once.

### Apps

Apps are how you define connections to your tools like your databases, email vendors, CRMs, etc. With each `App` you tell Grouparoo how to connect so we can import and export your data.

### Properties

`Properties` describe each `Profile Property` and how they work. It's a bit like a "Schema" for the `Profiles`:

- What `Profile Properties` exist? You cannot just add _any_ `Profile Property` to a `Profile`. You need to define it first.
- Is this `Profile Property` unique? If it is, Grouparoo will make sure that no other Profile can have the same value for that `Profile Property`. Common examples would be `email` or `user_id`.
- What is the type of this `Profile Property`? A number, a string? We actually stringify all of our Profile Property data for searching, but wen we render it back out again, we convert it. This also helps us know how to build search queries for Calculated `Groups`.
- How is this `Profile Property` to be retrieved? By which App? We talk more about this below.

Every `Profile Property` also includes a reference to an app (perhaps "MySQL-Datawarehouse") and a statement/query/option of how to get it for each Profile. Grouparoo will always be keeping your data in sync so we always need to know how to retrieve a `Profile`'s `Profile Properties`.

- For an `App` "MySQL-Datawarehouse" which is linked to the `Property` for "First Name (string)" you might provide a SQL statement like `select first_name from users where users.id={{ user_id }}`.
- You can also have more complex queries, like you could connect the `App` "MySQL-Datawarehouse" to the `Property` for "ltv (number)" which might do `select (sum(purchases.total) - sum(refunds.total)) as ltv from users join purchases on purchases.user_id = users.id join refunds.user_id = users.id where users.id={{ user_id }}`
- For a an app `CSV` responsible for "VIP (boolean)" you might choose "column" from a dropdown indicating that any column labeled "VIP" should be allowed to set this `Profile Property`

## Data into Grouparoo

### Sources, Schedules, and Runs

When you add an `App` to Grouparoo, you can also configure if you want Grouparoo to periodically check that app for new data. This might be accomplished by checking a database table for new/updated rows or asking an API for recent changes. This is called a `Schedule`. You can create many `Schedules` from a single `App`, against each `Source`. An `App` can have many `Sources`, often correlating to a logical collection in the `App`, e.g. Tables in a Database.

Perhaps the `App` "MySQL-Datawarehouse" has 4 `Schedules`:

1. "MySQL-Datawarehouse:users". This Schedule checks the "users" table every 10 minutes for new or updated records
2. "MySQL-Datawarehouse:carts". This Schedule checks the "carts" table every hour for only new carts
3. "MySQL-Datawarehouse:purchase". This Schedule checks the "purchase" table every hour for only new purchases.
4. "MySQL-Datawarehouse:refunds". This Schedule checks the "refunds" table every hour for only new refunds

Each `App` works a little differently, but you will be asked what to check for and how often. Each instance of a periodic check is called a `Run`. When new data is found, the `Run` will produce `Import`s.

### Imports

Imports are created when a `Schedules'` `Run` finds new or updated data. Either way, an `Import` tells Grouparoo that something has changed that we should take note of.

Most `Imports` trigger the update of a profile. An `Import` can be as simple as `{user_id: 3, firstName: 'Evan'}`. This tells us that we should update the `Profile` we have for user #3, and if we don't have a `Profile` for User #3, we should create one.

We know that the `Import`'s data we get should be saved to the related profile if:

1. The `Import`'s payload contains a unique `Profile Property` as defined by the `Profile Property Rules`
2. The other data key-value pairs are also defined by the `Profile Property Rules`.

`Imports` are stored in Grouparoo for later use. You can choose to delete old `Imports` after a period of time.

### Profile Hydration

Any time an `Import` is recorded by Grouparoo, and that `Import` can be linked to a `Profile`, Grouparoo will fully update that profile, checking all the `Apps` that are connected to it via `Profile Properties` and asking for new data. You can see which `Profile Properties` should be updated by checking if they are in the pending state or not. In this way, you can be sure that your `Profiles` are always up to date, and we can recover quickly from any new or missed data. We call this step "Profile Hydration".

This means that if an `Import` comes in from the "MySQL-Datawarehouse:purchase" `Import Schedules`, Grouparoo will automatically check all `Profile Properties`, including "ltv", "first_name" and everything else.

## Data out of Grouparoo

### Destinations

When configuring your `Destinations`, you'll be asked which `Groups` and `Profile Properties` you want to send (or all of them). You may want to sync "email" and "first_name" to your email tool for everyone in the `Group` "lapsed customers" and "USA Customers" so you can send them a coupon as part of your re-engagement campaign. Oh, and the `Group` "lapsed customers" is Dynamic, based on LTV>0, and last_purchase at least 2 months ago, while "USA Customers" is Dynamic where locale=en-us... all of which Grouparoo is keeping up-to-date for you.

To accomplish this you, would create an `Destination` for the `App` "Mailchimp", toggle on the "lapsed-customers" and "USA Customers" groups, and finally the requested `Profile Properties` of "email" and "first_name".

When Grouparoo sends data via a `Destination`, `Exports` are created.

### Exports

The Grouparoo `App` for Mailchimp will handle using the Mailchimp API to send the `Export` for you. Exports keep track of the exact data which was sent to the `Destination`. Grouparoo will try to send data in bulk when possible, handle retries, and skip any updates that won't result in any new information being sent to the Destination.

You can choose to delete old `Exports` after a period of time.

## Plugins and the Grouparoo Marketplace

Plugins are Grouparoo's way of providing more Apps to Grouparoo, allowing you to import and export data from more and more sources and destinations.
