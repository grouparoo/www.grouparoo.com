When you're ready to get your own instance of Grouparoo running, the first step is to install it locally. This will enable you to configure it properly before deploying to production.

### Step 1: Create New Repository

Configuring your Grouparoo Project starts by making a new `git` repository in a new directory. You then can use the [`grouparoo` cli tool](/docs/cli) to initialize a new project.

### Step 2: Pick an Installation Method

There are two methods for local development:

<h3>Run Locally with Node.js</h3>

If you have Node.js (v12+) installed, initializing a new Grouparoo project is as simple as:

```bash
# in a new directory
npx grouparoo init .
npm start
```

Read our guide for setting up Grouparoo locally with Node.js.

<h3>Run locally with Docker & Docker Compose</h3>

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, you can also run Grouparoo locally via a sample Docker Compose file:

```bash
# in a new directory
curl -L https://www.grouparoo.com/docker-compose --output docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

Continue with installation details in our Docker installation guide.

### What's Next?

After you've successfully installed Grouparoo, it's time to configure it. [Install the plugins](/docs/installation/plugins) you want to use and then head over to the [Configuration Guides](/docs/config).
