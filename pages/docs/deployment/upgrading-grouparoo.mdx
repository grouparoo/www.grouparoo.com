Grouparoo will regularly publish new versions of the packages that compose your Grouparoo application. Grouparoo packages are published to [npm](https://npmjs.com) under the `@grouparoo` and `@grouparoo-inc` organizations. For example you can view a list of [packages in the `@grouparoo` organization here](https://www.npmjs.com/org/grouparoo).

**We strongly recommend that you update your Grouparoo application as soon as a new version becomes available.** In addition to new features, new versions are likely to contain bug and security fixes.

## Determining if there are Updates

There are a few ways to determine if there are updates to the packages that make up your Grouparoo application:

**In App**

If you visit the `/about` page of your Grouparoo server, you'll see a list of the packages you have installed, the current version installed, and the latest version available on npm.

**Release Notes**

Grouparoo publishes release notes for new versions at [https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/releases](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/releases). Here you can see when each new version was released, and what was added.

**Tools from the Node.JS ecosystem**

As Grouparoo is a node.js application, there are a number of tools available to automatically notify you when there's an update to a dependency in your `package.json` file. Two recommendations are:

- **Depnedabot** - If you store your Grouparoo application in git hosted on Github.com, you can use [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) to check for dependency updates every day, week, or month. An example `dependaboy.yml` is available [here](https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example/blob/master/.github/dependabot.yml).
- **npm-check-updates** - The [npm check updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) package can be used in your Grouparoo project to scan your `package.json` and update the versions of your dependencies.

## Installing Updates

**Running New Versions**

All that is needed to update your Grouparoo application is update the versions of your dependencies in your `package.json` file, then run `npm install`.

Depending on your method of deployment, you will need to either re-deploy your application, `git push` to Heroku, or publish a new Docker image.

**Migrations**

The Grouparoo application uses `migration` files to describe changes in the schema of the Grouparoo application database. Any new release may contain a change to this schema and include a new migration file.

The Grouparoo application will automatically attempt to run pending migrations as the application starts. There is no special step needed to migrate your database.

**Breaking Changes**

Grouparoo follows [Semver versioning](https://semver.org/). This means that our version numbers mean `major`.`minor`.`patch`. Any breaking changes we make will result in a `major` version change. However, per Semver convention, we will not start tracking breaking changes until we reach version `1.0.0`. This means that before version `1.0.0`, any new version may contain a breaking change.

_Please be sure to read the release notes before upgrading._
