We have been updating how Grouparoo works with destinations in order to be more performant and responsive to their unique needs. Here are a few recent improvements:

- Settings for plugins to define how many threads can communicate with a destination at a time
- Patterns for responding to reaching an API limit and dynamically reacting
- Support for batching updates to send many profiles at a time
- In steady-state, only communicate with desitnation if there is a change in the data
- Hardened handling of intermittent errors from destinations
- Improved UI to track destination exports and their progress/status
