We have added the ability to connect your Google Sheets to import data into Grouparoo. To some degree, we made Grouparoo so you don't need all these spreadsheets. And yet, sometimes it's still the best way to make things happen. Now they can become a "real" part of your data infrastructure.

Don't forget: with great power comes great responsibility!
